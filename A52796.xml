            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THere is no doubt that Glaſs is one of the true fruits of the Art of fire, ſince that it is very much like to all ſort of minerals and midle minerals although it be a compound and made by Art. It hath fuſion in the fire, and permanencie in it; likewiſe as the perfect and ſhining Metall of Gold, it is refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and burniſhed, and made beautiful in the fire. It is manifeſt that it's uſe in drinking veſſels, and other things profitable for mans ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is much more gentile, graceful, and noble then any Metall or whatſoever ſtone fit to make ſuch works, and which beſides the eaſineſs and little charge wherewith it is made, may be wrought in all places; it is more delightful polite and ſightly, than any other material at this day known to the world. It is a thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, in the ſervice of the Art of diſtilling, and <hi>Spagyrical,</hi> not to ſay neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Medicines for man, which would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb facs="tcp:53743:5"/>
to be made without the means of Glaſs, ſo that herewith are made ſo many ſorts of Inſtruments, and Veſſels, as Bodies, Heads, Receivers, Pelicans, Lutes, Retorts, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, Serpentines, Vials, Cruces, ſquare and round Veſſels, Philoſophical Eggs, Globes, and infinite other ſorts of Veſſels, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day are invented to compoſe and make Elixars, Arcana, Quinteſſences, Salts, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs, Vitriols, Mercuries, Tinctures, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of Elements, all Metalline things, and many others, which every day are found out; and beſides there are made others for <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortis,</hi> and <hi>Aqua-regia,</hi> ſo neceſſary for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finers, and Maſters of Princes Mints, to Refine Gold and Silver, and to bring them to their perfection; indeed ſo many things profitable for mans uſe are made, that ſeem impoſſible to be made without the uſe of it: and the great Providence of God, is as well known, by this, as in every other thing, who hath made the matter of which Glaſs is compounded (a thing ſo needful and profitable to man) ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in every place and Region, which with much eaſe may be every where made. Glaſs is alſo a great ornament to the Churches of God, for herewith (beſides many other things) are made ſo many beautiful Glaſs veſſels
<pb facs="tcp:53743:5"/>
adorn'd with fair Pictures, wherein the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline colours are in ſuch ſort advanced, and ſo lively, that they ſeem to be ſo many Oriental Gems, and in the Glaſs Furnaces, the Glaſs is coloured with ſo many colours, with ſo much beauty and perfection, that it ſeems no material on the earth can be found like it. The invention of Glaſs (if it may be credited) is moſt antient, for the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in the Book of <hi>Job, Chap. 28.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gold and Glaſs ſhall not be equal to it, &amp;c.</hi> which gives clear teſtimony that Glaſs was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently invented, for Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Job</hi> deſcended from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and was the ſon of <hi>Zanech,</hi> who deſcended from <hi>Eſau,</hi> and ſo was the fifth from <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf; ſome will, and perhaps with ſome reaſon, that the invention of Glaſs was found out by the <hi>Alchymiſts;</hi> for they deſiring to Imitate Jewels, found out Glaſs; a thing perhaps not far from truth; for as I ſhew clearly in the fifth Book of the preſent work, the manner of imitating all Jewels, in which way is ſeen the vitrification of ſtones which of themſelves will never be melted nor vitrified. <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, that Glaſs was found by chance in <hi>Syria,</hi> at the mouth of the river <hi>Bellus,</hi> by certain Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Sea, and conſtrained to abide there, and to dreſs their proviſions, by making fire upon the ground, where was great ſtore of this ſort of herb which many call <hi>Kali,</hi> the aſhes whereof make <hi>Barillia,</hi> and <hi>Rochetta;</hi> This herb burned with fire, and therewith the aſhes &amp; Salt being united with ſand or ſtones fit to be vitrified is made Glaſs: A thing that inlightens mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding with the means, and manner of making not onely Glaſs, but Crystall and Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalline, and ſo many other beautiful things which are made thereof. Many aſſert that in the time of <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the way of making Glaſs malleable, a thing afterwards loſt, and to this day wholy unknown; for if ſuch a thing were now known without doubt it would be more eſteemed for it's beauty, and incorruptibility, than Silver and Gold; ſince from Glaſs there ariſeth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ruſt, nor taſt, nor ſmell, nor any other quality; Moreover it brings to man great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, In the uſe of proſpective Glaſſes and Spheres.</p>
            <p>And although one of them may be made of natural Cryſtall, called, that of the mountain, and the other with the mixture, called Steel, a compoſition made of Braſs and Tin, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in both, Glaſs is more profitable and
<pb facs="tcp:53743:6"/>
of leſs charge, and more beautiful and of greater efficiency: eſpecially in Sphears, which beſides the difficulty, and expences in making them, they preſent not to the life as Glaſs doth, and which is worſe, in a ſhort time they grow pale, not repreſenting any thing. Wherefore for theſe and many other reaſons, you may well conclude, that Glaſs is one of the moſt Noble things which man hath at this day, for his uſe upon the earth. I having laboured a long time in the Art of Glaſs, and therein ſeen many things, I was moved to make known to the world a part of that which I had ſeen and wrought therein. And although the manner of making Salt, Lees, and Frittaes, is known to many, yet notwithstanding it ſeemed to me, that this matter requires to be handled (as I do) clearly and diſtinctly, with ſome Obſervations and diligence, which if well conſidered will not be judged altogether unprofitable, but perhaps neceſſary and known to few: beſides in my particular way of extracting Salts, to make a moſt noble Crystall, that if the workman ſhall be diligent in making it, as I do publiſh and teach it, with clear demonstrations he ſhall do a thing as beautiful, and noble, as happily is made in theſe days, or can be done any other way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in this thing, and in every other
<pb facs="tcp:53743:7"/>
matter that I treat of in this preſent work, the diligent and curious operator ſhall find, that I have wrote and ſhown truth, not told me, or perſwaded me by any perſon whatſoever, but wrought and experimented many times with my own hands, I having always had this aim to write and ſpeak the truth. And if any one try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my receits, and manner of making colours, Paſte, and Tinctures, doth not ſpeed to do ſo much as I write thereof, let him not be amazed thereat, nor believe that I have writ untruths, but let him think that he hath erred in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and eſpecially they which have never handled ſuch things; For it is impoſsible that they at the firſt time ſhould be maſters: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them repeat the work, which they ſhall always make better, and at the laſt perfect as I deſcribe it. I warn them in particular to have conſideration in colours whoſe certain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate doſe cannot be given: but with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and practice one muſt learn, and with eye and judgment know when Glaſs is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coloured, conformable to the work, for which it ought to ſerve, and in Paſte made in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jewels conformable to the ſize, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they will make them, Obſerving that thoſe which are to be ſet in Gold, with Foyls, as in Rings, or other where, muſt always be clear, and
<pb facs="tcp:53743:7"/>
of a lighter colour. But thoſe that are ſet in Gold to ſtand hanging in the air, as Pendants, and the like, must be of a deeper colour, all which things it is impoſſible to teach, but all is left to the judgement of the Curious operator. Obſerve likewiſe, and with diligence that the materials and colours be well prepared, and well ground, and that he who will make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite work, may be the ſecurer, let him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, &amp; make all the colours himſelf as I teach, for ſo he ſhall be ſure that his work muſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ſucceed. The fire in this Art is of nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble importance, as that which makes every thing perfect, and without which nothing can be done: Wherefore conſideration is to be had in making it in proportion, and particularly with hard, and dry-wood, taking heed of it's ſmoak, which always hurteth, and endamageth it, eſpecially in furnaces, where the veſſels and pots ſtand open, and the Glaſs will then receive imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and notable foulneſs. Moreover, I ſay that if the operator ſhall be diligent, and ſhall do like a diligent and practiſed perſon, and ſhall work punctually as I have ſet down, he ſhall find truth in the preſent work, and that I have onely publiſhed, and ſet out to the world as much as I have tried and experimented. And if I find my pains acceptable to the world, as I hope I ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:53743:8"/>
be incouraged perhaps to publiſh my other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors wrought for many years in divers parts of the world in the Chymical and Spagyrical Arts, than which I think there is no greater thing in nature for mans ſervice, known and perfect in ancient times; which made men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in it to be held for Gods, which then were held and reputed for ſuch. I will not enlarge my ſelf any farther, becauſe I have in the work ſet down every particular, ſo clear, and diſtinct. I reſt ſecure, that he which will not err wilfully, it is impoſſible he ſhould do ſo having thereof once made experience and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. Therefore let all be taken of me in good part, as I have candidly made this preſent work, firſt, to the glory of God, and then to the juſt benefit and profit of all.</p>

            <p>IAm to advertiſe thee of ſome things, concerning the Tranſlation of this Book. You may take notice that I had firſt Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated it word for word, but finding that the Author had thorowout the whole, ſo often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame thing, by advice of ſome ingenuous perſons, I left out thoſe repetitions, and have either before the Books given a general account of theſe repetitions, or elſe have referr'd you to a former proceſs, where the latter hath reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame, and for the moſt part in the very ſame words, yet ſo that I have omitted nothing material in the Author: For what need is there to ſay, as ofteu as <hi>Manganeſe</hi> is boil'd with the metall, that you muſt do thus and thus, leſt it run into the fire, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> or to repeat the ſame proceſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and rules in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of Lead? Though you may find ſome needleſs repetitions too, in this Tranſlation not omitted. I confeſs theſe reiterations caus'd a nauſea in my ſelf, and believe they would in thee, and therefore I paſſed them over. Then obſerve that there being many words peculiar to this Art, I was compell'd to have recourſe to the workmen, and for ſueh things, and materials not uſed nor known here, to take them upon truſt from ſuch workmen as have wrought at <hi>Muran</hi> and other parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> As for other things I have carefully ſurveid them my ſelf. Now for the obſervations I have been more large, eſpecially in a buſineſs, wherein ſo little hath been ſaid, and therefore have delivered whatſoever is material that I have met with in any good Author concerning whatſoever <hi>Neri</hi> treats of, that thou might'ſt have together all that is ſubſtantially written upon this unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſubject, and have ſupplied ſome things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in our Author, or very fit to be known to Curious perſons.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53743:13"/>
would make a Cryſtall very perfect and beautifull, make it of ſalt extracted from <hi>Polverine</hi> or <hi>Rochetta</hi> of the <hi>Levant.</hi> For though <hi>Barillia</hi> yield more ſalt, yet Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall made therewith alwaies inclines to a blewneſs, and hath not that whiteneſs and fairneſs as that made of <hi>Polverine</hi> hath.</p>
                  <p>The way often by me practiſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the ſalt perfectly from both of them, is this which follows.</p>
                  <p>Powder theſe aſhes, and ſift them with a fine ſieve, that the ſmall pieces go not thorow, but onely the aſhes; the finer the ſieve, the more ſalt is extracted. In buying of either of theſe aſhes, obſerve that they abound in ſalt; this is known by touching them with the tongue, and taſting what ſalt they contain: but the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt way of all is, to make an eſſay of them in a melting-pot, and to ſee whether they bear much ſand, or <hi>Tarſo,</hi> a thing common in this Art, and which the Conciators very well know.</p>
                  <p>Set up braſs coppers with their furna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces like thoſe of the Dyers, greater or leſſer, according as you have occaſion to make a greater or leſſer quantity of ſalt:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53743:13"/>
fill theſe coppers with fair and clear wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and make a fire with dry wood, and when the water boyleth well, put in the ſifted <hi>Polverine</hi> in juſt quantity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the water, continue the fire and boyling till a third part of the water be conſumed, alwaies mixing them at the bottom with a ſcummer, that the <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verine</hi> may be incorporated with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and all its ſalt extracted; then fill the coppers with new water, and boyl it till<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> half be conſumed, and then you have a lee impregnated with ſalt. But that you may have ſalt in greater quantity, and whiter, put into the coppers when they boyl, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Polverine</hi> is put in, about 12 pound to a copper of <hi>Tartar</hi> of red wine, calcined<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only to a black colour, diſſolve it well in the boyling water, mingling it with a ſcummer, then put in the <hi>Polverine.</hi> This way of <hi>Tartar</hi> is a ſecret, and makes more, and whiter ſalt, and a more beautiful Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall. When two thirds of the water is eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated, and the lee well impregnated with ſalt, ſlacken the fire, under the cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and have in order many earthen pans, at firſt filled with common water for ſix daies, that they may imbibe leſs lee and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53743:14"/>
ſalt, and then with great braſs ladles, take the lee out of the copper, and put it into the ſaid pans, take out alſo the aſhes from the copper, and put them all into the ſame pans, and when they are full, let them ſtand ſo ten daies, for in that time the aſhes will be all at the bottom, and the lee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main very clear, then with braſs ladles, take gently (that the bottom be not raiſed, and troubled) the clear lee, and put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other empty pans, and ſo let the lee ſtand two daies, which by the ſetling of more terreſtriety at the bottom, becomes very clear, and limpid, let this be thrice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, and you ſhall have the lee moſt limpid, and diſcharged of all terreſtrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherewith a very fine and perfect ſalt is made. Let the coppers be filled again, and boyl with the ſame quantity of <hi>Tartar,</hi> and then the <hi>Polverine</hi> as before; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue this work till you have materials e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                  <p>To ſtrain the ſaid lees, and extract the ſalt, firſt waſh the coppers well with clear water, then fill them with the ſaid refined and clarified lees, and make them boyl ſoftly, as before, and obſerve that you fill the coppers with the ſaid lee, till you ſee
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53743:14"/>
it thicken, and ſhoot its ſalt, which is wont to be about the beginning of 24 hours, for then in the ſuperficies of the copper, you will begin to ſee white ſalt appearing like a ſpiders web, or white threed, then hold a ſcummer full of holes at the bottom of the copper, and the ſalt will fall upon it, and now and then take it out, ſuffering the lees to run out well off it into the copper, then put the ſalt into tubs, or earthen pans, that the lee may be better drained, the liquor that drains muſt be ſaved, and put into the copper, then dry the ſalt. Continue this work till all the ſalt be gotten out of the copper: but you muſt obſerve, when the ſalt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to ſhoot, to make a gentle and eaſie fire, for a great fire makes the ſalt ſtick to the copper, and then the ſalt becoming ſtrong, alwaies breaks the copper, which thing hath ſometimes hapned to me; wherefore obſerve this chiefly, uſing great patience and diligence. The ſalt in the pans, or tubs, being well drained, muſt be taken, and put into wooden tubs, or vats, the better to dry out all the moyſture, which happens in more, or fewer daies, according to the ſeaſon in which it is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53743:15"/>
made. The ſecret then of making much, and good ſalt, conſiſts in the <hi>Tartar,</hi> as is before demonſtrated. From every three hundred pound of aſhes, I uſually get from 80 to 90 pound of ſalt. When the ſalt is well dryed, beat it groſsly, and put it into the Calcar to dry, with a moſt gentle heat, and with an iron rake it muſt be broken, and mixed as the Fritt is; when it is well dryed from all its moiſture, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving alwaies that the Calcar be not very hot, but temperate, take it out of the Calcar, and pound it well, and ſift it ſo, that the greateſt pieces which paſs tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, exceed not the bigneſs of a grain of wheat.</p>
                  <p>This ſalt thus pounded, ſifted and dryed, muſt be kept by it ſelf, in a place free from duſt, for to make Fritt of Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall: the way to make this Fritt is this which follows.</p>

                  <p>WHen you would make fair, and fully perfect Cryſtal, ſee you have the whiteſt <hi>Tarſo,</hi> which hath not black veins, nor yellowiſh like ruſt in it. At <hi>Moran</hi> they uſe the pebles from <hi>Teſino,</hi> a ſtone abounding in that River. <hi>Tarſo</hi> then is a kind of hard, and moſt white mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, found in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> at the foot of the <hi>Verucola</hi> of <hi>Piſa,</hi> at <hi>Seraveza,</hi> and at the <hi>Maſſa</hi> of <hi>Carara,</hi> and in the River <hi>Arnus,</hi> above and below <hi>Florence,</hi> and it is alſo well known in other places. Note, that thoſe ſtones which ſtrike fire with a ſteel, are fit to vitrifie, and to make glaſs and Cryſtall, and thoſe which ſtrike not fire with a ſteel, will never vitrifie, which ſerves for advice to know the ſtones that may be tranſmuted, from thoſe that will not be tranſmuted into glaſs.</p>
                  <p>Take then of the beſt <hi>Tarſo,</hi> pounded
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53743:16"/>
ſmall, and ſerced as fine as flower, 200 pound; of ſalt of <hi>Polverine</hi> pounded, and fifted alſo, about 130 pound, mix them well together, then put them into the Calcar, which at firſt muſt be well heated, for if they be put into the Calcar when it is cold, Fritt will never be made of them. At firſt for an hour, make a temperate fire, and alwaies mix the Fritt with the rake, that it may be well incorporated, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined, then the fire muſt be increaſed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies mixing well the Fritt with the rake, for this is a thing of great importance, and you muſt alwaies do thus for 5 hours, ſtill continuing a ſtrong fire.</p>
                  <p>The Calcar is a kind of calcining fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, the rake is a very long inſtrument of iron, wherewith the Fritt is continually ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; both theſe are very well known, and uſed in all glaſs furnaces. At the end of 5 hours, take the Fritt out of the Calcar, which in that time (having had ſufficient fire, and being well ſtirred) is made and perfected. Then put this Fritt in a dry place on a floor, and cover it well with a cloath, that no duſt nor filth may fall upon it: for herein muſt be uſed great diligence, if you will have good Cryſtall. The Fritt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53743:16"/>
thus made, becomes as white as ſnow from Heaven. When the <hi>Tarſo</hi> is lean, you muſt add ſomewhat more than ten pound of the ſalt to the quantity aforeſaid. Wherefore let the experienced Conciators alwaies make tryal of the firſt Fritt, by putting it into a chryſible, which being put into the furnace, if it grow clear, and ſuddenly, they know whether the Fritt be well prepared, and whether it be ſoft, or hard, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the quantity of ſalt is to be increaſed, or diminiſhed. This Cryſtall Fritt muſt be kept in a dry place, where no moiſture is, for from moiſt places, the Fritt ſuffers much, the ſalt will grow moiſt, and run to water, and the <hi>Tarſo</hi> will remain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, which of it ſelf will never vitrifie: neither is this Fritt to be wetted, as others are. And when it is made, let it ſtand 3 or 4 months, and it will be much better to put into the pots, and ſooner waxes clear. This is the way to make Cryſtall Fritt, with the doſe and circumſtances, which I have oft times uſed.</p>

                  <p>FRitt is nothing elſe but a calcination of thoſe materials which make glaſs, and although they may be melted, and make glaſs without calcination, yet this would ſucceed with length of time and wearineſs, and therefore this calcination was invented to calcine the Fritt in the Calcar, which, when it is calcined, and the proportion of the materials is adjuſted agreeable to the goodneſs of the <hi>Barillia,</hi> preſently melts in the pot, and wonderfully clarifies.</p>
                  <p>Fritt made of <hi>Polverine</hi> makes ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary white glaſs; Fritt from <hi>Rochetta</hi> of the <hi>Levant</hi> makes the faireſt glaſs called Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall; <hi>Barillia</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> though it be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually fatter than the former, yet it makes not a glaſs ſo white and fair as that of the <hi>Levant,</hi> becauſe it always inclines a little to an azure colour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:53743:21"/>To make then Fritt, ſerce the <hi>Polverine</hi> thorow a fine ſerce, the ſmall pieces which paſs not, let them be pounded in ſtone mottars, the like is to be done with the <hi>Rochetta</hi> and <hi>Barillia,</hi> to wit every one by it's ſelf, and be ſure that they be well pounded, and ſerced thorow a fine ſerce; for as the common proverb in this art ſaith, A fine ſerce, and dry wood, bring honour to the furnace. Now whatſoever the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the <hi>Barillia</hi> be, for example, a 100 pound of it commonly requires, from 80 pound to 90 of <hi>Tarſo,</hi> which muſt be finely beaten, and then finely ſerced, more or leſs, according to the goodneſs of the <hi>Barillia,</hi> and it's fatneſs, whereof you need not make an eſſay, how much it holds as is known by art.

Now this ſand muſt be waſhed from all it's unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable terreſtriety, and ſerced, and then this will make a white and good glaſs; for <hi>Tarſo</hi> always makes much fairer glaſs than any ſand that is in <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> The due quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity

of ſand or <hi>Tarſo,</hi> being found out, mix and unite them, firſt well together with the <hi>Barillia</hi> or <hi>Polverine</hi> well ſifted, and ſo put them into the Calcar when it is hot, &amp; at firſt mix &amp; ſpread them well in the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car, with a rake, that they may be well calcined, and continue this till they begin to grow into lumps, and come into pieces as big as ſmall nuts. The Fritt will be well and perfectly wrought in the ſpace of 5 hours, being ſtirred all that time, and a ſufficient fire continued, and when you would ſee whether it be well made, take a little of it out, when cold, if it be white, yellowiſh and light, then 'tis made. The calcining of it more than 5 hours is not amiſs; for by how much more it is wrought and calcined, the better it is, and the ſooner it melteth in the pot, and by ſtanding a little longer in the Calcar it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth and loſeth the yellowneſs and foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which glaſs hath in it ſelf, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more clear and purified. When the Fritt is taken out of the Calcar thus hot, let there be thrown upon it 3 or 4 pails of cold water, then ſet it under ground, in a moiſt and cold place, and the filth which aroſe when the ſalt was made (as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

Now when it is in the pot it ſoon melteth ſtupendiouſly, and maketh glaſs as white as Cryſtall. For this Lee leaves upon the Fritt it's ſalt which worketh this effect. When this Lee is not to be had it muſt be water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with common water, which although it doth not work this great effect as the ſaid lee, yet it doth well, and maketh it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier for melting.

                  <p>TAke Cryſtall Fritt diligently made, ſet it in pots in the furnace, where there are no pots with colours, for the fumes of metalls whereof the greateſt part of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are made, make the Cryſtall pale and foul, but that it may come forth white, ſhining, and fair, when you put the Fritt into the pots in the furnace, then caſt in ſuch a quantity of <hi>Manganeſe</hi> prepared as is needful, according as the pots are, greater or leſs. For this lieth in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the able and diligent Conciatore, and belongs to his office. The quantity of the <hi>Manganeſe</hi> and of all other colours to be put into the Fritt and metalls cannot be preciſely determined either by weight or meaſure, but muſt be wholly left to the eye and judgement, tryal and experience of the Conciatore. To make a fair Cryſtal, when it is well melted take it from the pots, and caſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53743:23"/>
it into great earthen pans, or clean bowls ful of clean water (for it requireth to be caſt into water) to this end that the water may take from it a ſort of ſalt called <hi>Sandever,</hi> which hurteth the Cryſtall, and maketh it obſcure and cloudy, and whilſt it is a working ſtill caſteth forth <hi>Sandever,</hi> a thing very foul. Then put it again into a clean pot, and caſt it into water, which is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated as often as is needful, until the Cryſtal be ſeparated from all this ſalt, but this is to be left to the practice of the Conciator, then ſet it to boil 4 or 6 days, and let as little Iron be mixed therewith as is poſſible, for it gives it always a black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh tincture.

                  <head>CHAP. XXII.</head>
                  <p>SEa-green is one of the principal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours given to glaſs, and if you would have it fair, and to hold at all trials, you muſt always make it in glaſs called Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Cryſtal; for in ordinary metall it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth not fair: and though in Cryſtalline it ariſeth fairer than in common glaſs, yet in the ſaid Cryſtal, onely in perfection. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that when ever you would make this colour, you in no wiſe add any <hi>Manganeſe</hi> at firſt, becauſe this being added (although the fire afterwards conſumes it,) yet it leaves a quality in the glaſs, which makes the colour black, and gives it great imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and foulneſs. Now to make a fair Sea-green, take of Cryſtal Fritt, and put it in a pot, not allowing it any <hi>Manganeſe</hi> at all, and as ſoon as it is melted and clear, it yields a ſalt which ſwims at the top like oyl, let this be taken off with Iron ladles,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53743:31"/>
by the Conciators, take it out with much diligence, for what remains thereof, will make a foul, and oyly colour, and when the glaſs is well and perfectly clarified, take a pot of about twenty pound of Cryſtal, ſix ounces of Braſs prepared as is aforeſaid, and to this Braſs calcin'd, add a fourth part of <hi>Zaffer</hi> prepared, and let theſe two pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders be well mixed, and put to the ſaid Cryſtal at three times, but at firſt this powder will make the metall ſwell very much, and you muſt well mix the glaſs with the long ſquares. Then let the metall ſettle, that the colour may be incorporated for three hours, then mix them again with the long ſquare, then take a proof thereof, in doing whereof, put in rather too little than too much, for the colours may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily heightned, which is to be done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the works for which it is to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, for groſs tubes for counting houſes require not ſo deep and full a colour, and tubes to make beads of, muſt not have too light a colour. At the beginning of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four hours (after it hath had the due colour) it may be wrought, and before you work it, mix well the metall from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bottom of the pot, that the colour may

I know not whether any have tried this way, which I have found wonderful, wherefore I ſay 'tis my own invention.</p>

This ſalt ſo calcin'd, keep to make a Blew or <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cois</hi> colour. Put into a ſmall or great pot of Cryſtal metall died with the colour of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green (made, as hath been ſaid many ways.) But let the colour be fair and full (for this is of great importance to make a fair Skie colour) according as you would have the Sea-green fair and excellent. To this metall ſo coloured, put of the ſaid ſalt calcin'd into the pots, mixing it well with the metall, and this is to be put in by little and little until the Sea-green loſe it's
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53743:40"/>
tranſparencie, and diaphanietie, and takes opacity, for the ſalt being vitrified makes the metall loſe it's tranſparencie, and gives it a little paleneſs, and ſo by little and little makes the ſaid Skie colour, which is the colour of a <hi>Turcois-ſtone;</hi> when the colour is enough it muſt be wrought ſpeedily, for the ſalt will be loſt and evaporated, and the metall returns again to be tranſparent and foul-coloured. But when the colour is loſt in working add new burnt ſalt (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that the colour may be reduced, and ſo you ſhall have your deſired colour.

The quantity of ſalt muſt be put in by little and little, leaving ſome diſtance between each time, till he ſee the deſired colour. But in this I uſed neither doſe nor weight, but my eye onely.

                  <p>SInce I am to ſhew the manner how to make <hi>Calcidonies, Jaſpers</hi> and Oriental <hi>Agats,</hi> it is neceſſary firſt to teach the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53743:42"/>
preparation of ſome mineral things, for ſuch compoſitions, and although ſome of them may be publiquely bought, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, I being deſirous that the work ſhould be perfect judged it perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to my purpoſe to ſhew the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Chymical way, that the skilful may make every thing of themſelves, both more perfect and with leſſer charge. For there is no doubt that when the materials are well prepared, and the colour of the metalls is well opened, and ſeparated from their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity and terreſtriety which uſually hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ingreſs of their tincture into glaſs, and their union in their ſmalleſt parts, that then they colour the glaſs with lively, ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and fair colours, which very far ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs thoſe that are vulgarly, and uſually made in the furnace. And becauſe the colour of <hi>Calcidony,</hi> or rather it's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound (which is nothing elſe, but as it were a reuniting of all the colours, and toyes that may be made in glaſs, a thing not common nor known to all) if they be not well prepared, and ſubtiliſed as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, they give not the beauty and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to glaſs as is required. Wherefore it is neceſſary that the metalls be well cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53743:42"/>
ſubtiliſed, and opened with the beſt <hi>Aqua-fortis, Sulphurs, Vitriols, ſal Armoniak</hi> and the like materials, which in length of time, and at a gentle heat, are opened and well prepared, but a violent fire herein hurteth much. <hi>Tartar</hi> and <hi>Roſichiero</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their being very perfect and well calcined) muſt be alſo put in proportion and in fit and due time, and you muſt alſo obſerve, that the metall be well boiled, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and perfected, and in working of it ſome ſuch care is to be uſed, as the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent maſters are wont to uſe, and by thus doing the true <hi>Jaſper</hi> and <hi>Agat,</hi> and Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Calcidonies,</hi> with the faireſt and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt ſpots of wavings, and toyes, with divers lively and bright colours. Hence it truly appears that nature cannot arrive ſo high in great pieces, and although it is ſaid and may be made to appear true, that Art cannot attain to Nature, yet experience in many things ſhews, and in particular in this art of the colours in glaſs, that art doth not onely attain to and equal nature, but very fair ſurpaſſes and excells it. If this were not ſeen, hardly would you believe the beauty, the toyes and wavings of divers colours, variouſly disjoyned one from the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53743:43"/>
other with a pleaſing diſtinction, which is ſeen in this particular of the <hi>Calcidony.</hi> When the medicine is well prepared, and the glaſs wrought at a due time, the effect that cometh thence paſſeth all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conceit of man. In the three ways to make it, which I teach, I believe you may ſee how far the art of glaſs ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in this particular, where I demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate every particular ſo diſtinctly, that any practitioner, and skilful perſon, may underſtand and work without errour, and he that works well may find out more than I ſet down.</p>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53743:43"/>
it; to every pound of this ſtuff add an ounce of Cryſtalline Arſnick (this is a ſecret and no ordinary thing) which beſides it's giving more ſtrength to the water, helps to extract better the ſpirits from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, which are the true nerves and ſtrength of the <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> without which the water perhaps would be no better than well-water. Powder and mix them well together, adding thereunto the tenth part in the whole of Lime, well powdred, mix them well, and put ſo much of this ſtuff into glaſs bodies, that about three quarters of them may be full, let them be luted with ſtrong lute, which I remit to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt as a common thing: but one not vulgar I will declare. Take ſome lome for example of the river <hi>Arnus</hi> (which is a fat earth known to all) one part, of ſand 3 parts, of common wood-aſhes well ſifted, of ſhearings of woollen cloath, of each one half; mix them well together, and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate them into a paſt with common wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, work them well together, for the more 'tis wrought the better 'tis, therefore ſee that your paſt be a little hard, to all theſe add a third of common ſalt, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> incorporate well with the lute, 'tis a buſineſs of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53743:44"/>
then lute the glaſſes with this perfect lute, and ſet them in wind furnaces, fitting to their bottoms, baked earth which will bear the fire. Under the bottom of theſe bodies, let there be four fingers of ſand, &amp; thick Iron bars to bear the weight, &amp; fill'd round about with ſand, put receivers of glaſs to them, large and capacious within, lute the joynts well with lute made of fine flowre and lime, of each a like quantity, powdred, mixed, tempered, and impaſted with the whites of Eggs well beaten, with this lute, binde and lute the joynts with roulers of fine linnen, which, when well dryed and rould about three or four times, make a very ſtrong lute, rouling but once at a time, and letting it dry a little before the ſecond rouling. And then this will bear all the violence, fury, and force of the ſpirits of the <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> and to this end fit exactly a very large receiver to every glaſs body. And when they are well dryed make a fire in the furnace onely with coal at firſt, and that a very temperate one, for three hours, for in that time the windy moiſture diſtilleth off, which endangers the breaking of the glaſſes, and continue for ſix hours a moderate fire, afterwards
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53743:44"/>
encreaſe it gently, adding billets of dry oaken wood to the coals, and ſo proceed by little and little, augmenting it for ſix hours more, and then the head will be tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with Yellow, a ſign that the ſpirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to riſe; continue this degree of fire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the ſpirits beginning to condenſate co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour Red the receiver and head, which will always grow deeper colour'd like a Rubie. Then encreaſe the fire for many hours, till the head and receiver become Red, which ſometimes laſteth two whole days. Continue the fire by all means till all the ſpirits of <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> be diſtill'd off, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is known, when the head &amp; receivers by little and little, begin to grow clear, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come white as at firſt, and wholly cold; yet notwithſtanding continue the fire one hour more. Then let the furnace cool of it's ſelf. Obſerve, that when the head and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers are Red, and the fire ſtrong, you admit no wind, nor cold air into them, nor touch them with any cold thing, for then they will eaſily crack, and your pains, coſt and time will be loſt, wherefore when they are in this ſtate, let them be kept hot in the fire. Now, when all is cold, put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head and receiver linnen cloaths
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53743:45"/>
wetted and well ſoaked in cold water, that the ſpirits which are about the head and receiver may the better ſink into the <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortis,</hi> leave them thus for 12 hours, then bath the joynts and lutings with warm water, till they being moiſtned you may take off the bandage, and the head from the receiver, which uſually are ſafe. The bodies may be broke and thrown away, for they will ſerve no more, powder the dregs and reſidences of the <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> to wit, about their third part, and to every pound of them add four ounces of Salt-peter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and put them into another body lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and pour on them the ſaid <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> lute and diſtil them as before in every thing.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53743:47"/>
thrice calcin'd Copper, Blew ſmalts of the Painters, and Red-lead, of each half an ounce, powder all theſe well, and put one after another into the body, which then ſtir gently that the <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> may be incorporated well with the ſaid powder, keep the body cloſe ſtoped for ten days, every day ſtirring it well ſeveral times, and when they are well opened, then put it into a furnace on ſand, and make a moſt temperate heat, ſo that in 24 hours all the <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> may be evaporated. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that at laſt you give not a ſtrong but a gentle heat, that the ſpirits of the <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortis</hi> may not evaporate, and in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome there will remain a Lion colour, which being well powdered, keep in a glaſs veſſel. When you would make a <hi>Calcidony,</hi> put into a pot very clear metall and made of broken pieces of Cryſtall veſſels, and Cryſtalline, and white glaſs which hath been uſed. For with the Virgin <hi>Fritt</hi> which hath never been wrought, the <hi>Calcidony</hi> can never be made, and the colours ſtick not to it, but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by the <hi>Fritt.</hi> To every pot of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 20 pound of glaſs, put two ounces, or two ounces and a half, or three ounces
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53743:48"/>
of this powder, or medicine, at three times, and incorporate, and mix them, that the glaſs may take in the powder, in doing whereof it raiſeth certain Blew fumes, as ſoon as it is well mixed let the glaſs ſtand an hour, then put in another mixture, and ſo let it alone 24 hours, then let the glaſs be well mixed, and take thereof an eſſay, which will have a Yellowiſh A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure colour, this proof being returned many times into the furnace, and taken when it begins to grow cold, will ſhew ſome waves, and divers colours very fair. Then take <hi>Tartar</hi> eight ounces, ſoot of the Chimny well virrified two ounces, <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> calcin'd with Brimſtone half an ounce, put by little and little all theſe well powdered and mixed into this glaſs at ſix times, expecting a little while at each time, ſtill mixing the glaſs that the powder may be well incorporated. As ſoon as all the powder is put in, let the glaſs boil, and ſettle 24 hours at leaſt, then make a little glaſs body of it, which put in the furnace many times, and ſee if the glaſs be enough, and if there be on the outſide toyes of Blew, and Sea-green, Red, Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and all colours with toys, and it
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53743:48"/>
hath ſome waves, ſuch as <hi>Calcidony, Jaſpers,</hi> Oriental <hi>Agats</hi> have, and that the body kept within be as to the ſight as red as fire. Now as ſoon as it is made and perfected, it is wrought into veſſels always variegated, which are not to be remade, for they do not ariſe well. Theſe veſſels may be made of divers ſorts, and drinking glaſſes of many faſhions, broad drinking cups, ſalts, flower pots, and the like toyes, ſtill obſerving that the maſter workman pinch off well ye glaſs (that is wrought) with pincers, and anneal it ſufficiently, that it may make waves and toyes of the faireſt colours. You may alſo make with this pot diſhes, pretty large in <hi>Oval, triangular, quadrangular</hi> form, as you will, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards work it at the wheel (as Jewels) for it takes poliſhing, and a fine luſtre, and it may ſerve for little tables, and cabinets; ſo that thoſe little Jewels will repreſent the Oriental <hi>Agat, Jaſper,</hi> and Oriental <hi>Calcidony,</hi> and when it happens that the colour fadeth, and the glaſs becomes tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparent, and no more Opacous as it ought to be for theſe works, then ceaſe from working, put to it new <hi>Tartar</hi> calcin'd, ſoot
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53743:49"/>
and <hi>Crocus,</hi> for thus (as before) it takes a body and Opacouſneſs, and makes the colours appear; ſet it then to purifie many hours, that the new powder put in may be incoporated, as 'tis uſual, then work it. This was my way to make <hi>Calcidony</hi> in the year 1661 in <hi>Florence,</hi> at <hi>Caſino</hi> in the glaſs furnaces; at which time I cauſed to work in the furnace, the brave Gentleman <hi>Nicolao Landiamo</hi> my familiar friend, and a man rare in working Enamels at the lamp, in which furnace I made many cups of <hi>Calcidony</hi> at the ſame time, which always were fair to all eſſays, never departing from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid rules, and having the materials well prepared.</p>

Obſerve my rules in all theſe glaſſes made of Lead exactly, and you ſhall avoid all danger. This buſineſs principally conſiſts in knowing well how to calcine Lead, and to recalcine it alſo a ſecond time; For by how much 'tis better and more calcined, by ſo much the leſs it returns to Lead; Again, and by conſequence the leſs breaks out the bottom of the pot. Secondly, caſt the metall into water, and ſeparate carefully the Lead from the glaſs, even the leaſt grains of it. This glaſs of lead muſt be caſt into the water by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, to make a better ſeparation, for the leaſt Lead remaining breaks out the bottom of the pots, and lets all the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall run into the fire.</p>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53743:81"/>
leaſt not ſhewn to me by any perſon. Wherefore I will ſhew the manner to make them, ſo clearly, and with ſo many circumſtances and obſervations, that any one verſed in Chymiſtry will be eaſily ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable thereof, and will do the work per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly. Take Ceruſs, otherwiſe call'd white lead, grind it very fine, and put it into a great glaſs body, and pour therein as much diſtil'd Vineger as will riſe a palm above it. Obſerve that at firſt the vineger boils and ſwels, wherefore put it in by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, till all the fury and noiſe is gone. Then ſet the Vineger on a hot fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace in ſand, and evaporate away the eighth part of it, take it from the fire, and when the body is cold, decant leaſurely the Vineger coloured enough, and impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſalt, which ſet aſide in a glaſs veſſel, then pour more freſh diſtild Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on the Ceruſs, and evaporate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant as before. Repeat this till you have extracted all the ſalt from the Ceruſs, which is when the Vineger is coloured no more, nor hath any more taſte of ſweetneſs, which uſually ſucceeds the ſixth time. Then Filtre theſe coloured Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53743:81"/>
mixt together, evaporate and dry them in a glaſs body, and the ſalt of Lead will be at the bottom of a white co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Which ſet in ſand in a glaſs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from the neck downwards well luted, but the mouth of the glaſs muſt be open, and the furnace heated for twenty four hours continuance. Then take the ſalt out of the receiver, powder it, and if it be Yellowiſh and not Red, ſet it twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four hours in the fire, till it become as Red as <hi>Cinaber.</hi> Make a good fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not to melt it, for then all your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and pains will be loſt. Pour di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled Vineger on this Red-lead cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd, repeating this work as before till you have extracted all the ſalt from it, and ſeparated all the dregs and terreſtrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in whole or in part. Keep theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured Vinegers in earthen pans glaſed ſix days, that all the terreſtriety and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection may ſink to the bottom. Then Filtre them, leaving the groſſer part at the bottom as unprofitable, then cover the Vinegers in a glaſs body, and there will remain at the bottom a moſt white ſalt of lead, and ſweet as Sugar, which dry
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53743:82"/>
well and diſſolve in common water, let the ſolution ſtand ſix days in glaſed pans, ſeparate the terreſtriety at the bottom, Filtre and evaporate as before, and there will remain at the bottom of the glaſs a ſalt as white as ſnow, and ſweet as Sugar, Repeat this Solution, Filtration, and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration thrice. This ſalt is called <hi>Sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charum Saturni.</hi> Which put into a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace into a body of glaſs in Sand, and at a temperate heat for many days, and it will appear calcin'd into a colour much redder than <hi>Cinaber,</hi> and as ſubtile and impalpable as the fineſt ſerced wheaten flour. This is call'd the true Sulphur of <hi>Saturn</hi> purified from all terreſtriety, foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and blackneſs which <hi>Saturn</hi> had at firſt in it ſelf. Now when you would make paſts for Emeralds, Saphyres, Garnats, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paz, Chryſolite, Sky or any other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, take the ſame materials, colours, quantities as aboveſaid in the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, except that inſtead of ordinary Red-lead, you ſhall take Sulphur <hi>Saturni,</hi> working exactly in every thing as before And you ſhall have Jewels of marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fairneſs in all colours, which very

The reaſon why <hi>Glaſtum</hi> acquired this name <hi>Vitrum,</hi> or Glaſs, might be, becauſe all glaſs hath Naturally (as this Author and experience teacheth) ſomewhat of blewiſhneſs in it. <hi>Vitrum</hi> comes from <hi>Viſum</hi> as <hi>Aratrum</hi> and <hi>Rutrum</hi> come from <hi>Artum &amp; retum,</hi> the laſt ſyllable being changed into <hi>trum,</hi> ſo <hi>Iſcodurus, lib. 16. cap. 15. Quod viſui perſpicuitate transluceat,</hi> becauſe it is tranſparent to the ſight: for in other metalls, whatſoever is contained within is hid, but in Glaſs all liquors, and things within appear the ſame as without, hence it is that many tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent bodies are call'd <hi>Vitrea,</hi> as the humour of the eye, the Sea, Rivers, Waters by Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>Horace, Ovid,</hi> and <hi>Boeth,</hi> and <hi>Apuleius</hi> of a ſpring.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glaſs is one of the fruits of the fire.</hi> Which is moſt true, for it is a thing wholy of Art, not of Nature, and not to be produced without ſtrong fires. I have heard a ſingular
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53743:116"/>
Artiſts merrily to this purpoſe ſay, that their profeſſion would be the last in the world: for when God ſhould conſume with fire the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, that then all things therein would Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie and turn to glaſs. Which would be true upon ſuppoſition of a proportionable mixture of fit Salts, and Sand or Stones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>'Tis much like all ſort of mineral or middle mineral.</hi> I find Authors differ much about referring Glaſs to it's Species. <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola, lib. 12. de Metallis,</hi> maketh it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete juyce, <hi>Vincent Belluaſenſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But to me it ſeems neither of theſe, which this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Argument ſufficiently evinceth, that all the forementioned are natural concretes, but Glaſs is a compound made by Art, a product of the fire, and never found in the bowels of the earth, as all the others are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore as factitious words of Art are excluded out of the predicaments by the <hi>Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> ſo is Glaſs to be excluded out of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Species.

asking of what Glaſs we ſpeak, whether of that which is in it's own Mine, and it's own ſtone, or elſe of true Glaſs, and now extracted from the ſtone? if of this purified, he ſaith 'tis no more Artificial, than a metall is extracted from it's Mineral, and purified. But if we underſtand it of that which is the firſt ſtone, then he ſaith that as metall in the Mine and proper stone, ſo glaſs having it's existence in the ſtone, whence 'tis educed, is natural. To whom I anſwer, that Glaſs is never found in that form in any Mine, but onely Sand, and Stones which are the Materials of it. But of Metalls 'tis far otherwiſe, which nature hath perfectly formed into a certain Species in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per veins, though ſometimes they are by the fire forced out of the veins, and Earth or ſtones wherein they in ſmaller particles and Atoms lay hid. And with this difference too, that fire onely produceth or rather diſcovereth Metalls by it's innate energie of ſeparating heterogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bodies and congregating homegeneous: But in Glaſs 'tis far otherwiſe, for that is made by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>iting and mixing different parts of ſalt and ſand. Which <hi>Fallopius</hi> to admiration denies, ſaying, that 'tis falſe that Glaſs is made of Aſhes and he adds, that although Glaſs-men add aſhes brought from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or from
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53743:117"/>
other places, yet he ſaith that aſhes is added inſtead of Nitre which the Ancients uſed, that they might more eaſily extract Glaſs from the Metalline ſtone. Yet we may not ſay that aſhes is mixed with the Metall to make Glaſs, but that 'tis onely put into the furnaces where Glaſs is melted, that Glaſs may be more eaſily educed from the ſmalleſt and inmoſt particles of the Glaſs-ſtone, that is, of it's proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall; ſo far he. But this ſtrange opinion is eaſily confuted; for if Glaſs were extracted from the ſtones onely, then the weight of the Metall muſt needs be far leſs than the ſtones alone, but in truth the weight of the Metall far ſurpaſſeth that weight, for 100 weight of Sand yields a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 150 of Metall; beſides, the Salts compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Glaſs are the moſt fixed ſalts, which the fire cannot raiſe with the moſt vehement heat. Again in old windows of <hi>French</hi> Glaſs, in that part which lies towards the air, you may manifeſtly diſcern, nay, pick out pieces of ſalt, eaſily diſcovering their nature to the taſt; furthermore in the fineſt Glaſſes, wherein the ſalt is moſt purified and in a greater propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſalt to the ſand, you ſhall find that ſuch Glaſſes ſtanding long in ſubterraneous and moiſt places will fall to pieces, the union of the ſalt and ſand decaying. And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53743:118"/>
of that ſaying, that <hi>Venice</hi> Glaſſes will break with poiſon, which is true of ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but not of Vegetable or animal poyſon. All which manifeſtly evince that ſalt remains in the Glaſs in ſpecie. Add hereunto that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of <hi>Helmont, Cap. de terra,</hi> who thus ſaith, <hi>Si vitri pollinem pluri alkali quis colliquaverit ac humido loco expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuerit, reperiet mox totum vitrum reſolvi in aquam, cui ſi affundatur Chryſulea, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dito quantum ſaturando alkali ſuffecerit, inveniet ſtatim in fundo arenam ſedere eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem pondere quae prius faciendo vitro aptabatur.</hi> If you melt fine flour of Glaſs with good ſtore of <hi>Sandever,</hi> and ſet them in a moiſt place, you ſhall ſoon find all the Glaſs reſolved into water, whereunto if you pour as much <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> as will ſuffice to ſaturate the <hi>Sandever,</hi> you ſhall find the ſand preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſettle to the bottom in the ſame weight which was put in at firſt.</p>
               <p>And in this experiment the ſalt is imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and taken up by the <hi>Sandever,</hi> and <hi>Aqua Regis,</hi> and ſo the component parts analyſed into their former principles, which were before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed in the compound.</p>
               <p>A ſecond general argument is this, that though the ſaid concrete juyces stones and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53743:118"/>
Glaſs, may have fuſion in the fire, yet neither all ſtones, nor all concrete juyces, Metalls, nor Semimetalls have fuſion, ſuch are <hi>Talc</hi> and <hi>Engliſh Spaud, ſal Armoniack, Tincal, &amp;c.</hi> Reckoned amongſt concrete juyces; nor <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, Cats-eyes, Agate, Jaſpers,</hi> nor moſt other pretious ſtones, nor Marble; Nor many other ſtones wherewith the inſide of thoſe furnaces are built. Neither can <hi>Mercurie</hi> amongſt Metalls be ſaid to melt, nor amongſt the middle Minerals <hi>Orpiment;</hi> and though moſt of them have fuſion, yet none of them have ductilitie, but Metalls onely, and they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too, when they have received a great degree of cold; for when they are red hot the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of them ſtick not together; nor are ſo Tenacious as Glaſs is, which onely whilſt it is red hot, will with ſmall force of the breath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any faſhion or figure, and by blowing form a cavity, none whereof any of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid bodies will do; beſides metall poured out, when melted, will run into many ſmall globuli, or pieces, but glaſs ſticks together in a lump even in the furnace it ſelf, when the pots are broken. And this quality of ductility, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacity, I make to be the eſſential difference of glaſs from all other bodies; nay from all other ſubſtances, which have gotten the name
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53743:119"/>
of glaſs, as <hi>Vitrum Antimonii, Moſcovie</hi> glaſs, and bricks or other ſtones vitrified, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whereof will bear this tryal. Which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have their denomination from their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparency, (as <hi>Vitriolum</hi> too hath a <hi>Vitro</hi>) than from their intrinſecal nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. But to ſhorten this compariſon, I ſhall here ſet down the proprieties of glaſs, whereby any one may eaſily difference it from all other bodies.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But to decide this controverſie, 'tis manifeſt that Glaſs could not be unknown to the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi> and muſt needs be as <hi>Antient</hi> as <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie</hi> it ſelf, or the <hi>Art</hi> of making <hi>Bricks,</hi> for ſcarcely can a Kill of <hi>Bricks</hi> be burnt, or a Batch of <hi>Pottery</hi> ware be made, but ſome of the <hi>Bricks,</hi> and ware will be at leaſt ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially turn'd to Glaſs. And therefore without doubt 'twas known at the building of the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> and as long before as that Art was uſed, and likewiſe by the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> for when the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, we read that making of <hi>Bricks</hi> was a great part of their bondage. And of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt that Foſſil Glaſs be, whereof <hi>Ferant Imperatus, lib. 25. cap. 7.</hi> thus ſaith, Glaſs like to the <hi>Artificial</hi> is found under the earth in places where great fires have been, neither whereof ſtruck yield ſparks of fire. Other Glaſſes are found in round clots like fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, ſhining in the breaking, and tranſparant with greeneſs, which in ſhew reſemble <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonia,</hi> and theſe struck ſparkle like fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones. From which notwithſtanding they are
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53743:123"/>
different as well in their Vegetation proper to fire ſtones, as alſo in ſhining, and much quicker melting, proper to Glaſs. Of theſe ſaid Glaſſes ſome are brittle, others ſolid, the brittle or crumbling, put in the fire, ſwell, and take the ſhape of white pumice-ſtone, and afterwards the ſhining of <hi>Artificial Glaſs:</hi> But thoſe which are continued and ſolid, by a ſmall change from the fire, paſs from blackneſs to white <hi>Artificial Glaſs.</hi> This Foſſil Glaſs is wrought by the <hi>Americans</hi> to make holes, and cut inſtead of Iron. So far he. And happily of this ſort of Glaſs, was a piece thereof, which I lighted on at S. <hi>Albans,</hi> an antient garriſon of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which I ſtruck off from a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Brick,</hi> 'tis of the ſame colour and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with what appears in ours at this day.</p>
               <p>And no doubt but this Glaſs was more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in their Brick than ours, for they temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their earth two years together, and ſo it wrought more firm, and cloſe; beſides, they burnt them better. And this vitrification of earth made into <hi>Bricks,</hi> is not onely at the firſt burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, but alſo as <hi>Imperatus</hi> obſerves might be from great fires, to wit ſuch as are in lime-Kils, and <hi>Potters</hi> Kils, ſuch as were moſt <hi>Antient</hi> in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> for in thoſe the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:53743:124"/>
                  <hi>Bricks</hi> uſually Vitrifie. But I have not heard nor ſeen any of them Vitrified in the firing of houſes built therewith. For it ſeems that onely a fire made with layers of dried crude <hi>Bricks</hi> burnt in the fire, can produce this effect, or elſe by the way of Reverberation in furnaces where moſt vehement cloſe &amp; continued fires are made.</p>
               <p>This Glaſs lay long in the earth, though <hi>Helmont</hi> affirms that Glaſs there diſſolves, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifies and turns to water, in few years. which though true in our finer Cryſtal, as to the ſaline part, yet ſéems not ſo of Glaſs in general.</p>
               <p>As for the way mentioned by our <hi>Author</hi> found out by Merchants, it ſeems not very cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, ſince the continual burning of <hi>Kali</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> for <hi>Barillia</hi> and <hi>Polve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> and of <hi>Kelp,</hi> and other Materials for green Glaſs with us, in greater quantities, than the ſaid Merchants did to dreſs their provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and conſequently a ſtronger and more laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat raiſed thereby, did never produce Glaſs in any place or time whatſoever, nay the ſtrong and cloſe heat of the calcar, cannot produce it; Perhaps thoſe that refine Metalls from the <hi>Ore.</hi> whereof <hi>Tubalcain</hi> was the inventor or <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Chymiſts,</hi> could not but hoth in their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces and from their Metalls long wrought upon by the fire, obſerve Glaſs alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:53743:124"/>Amongſt thoſe Chymiſts, the most antient ſeem to be <hi>Egyptian</hi> Princes, who all from <hi>Hermes Triſmegiſtus</hi> downwards profeſſed this art, indeavouring at an univerſal Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, but not the ſuppoſed tranſmutation of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, as <hi>Kircher</hi> in his <hi>Alchymia Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyph.</hi> affirms. Now this attempt could not be without great fires and furnaces, which muſt at ſome time or other run into Glaſs, and their materialls alſo muſt do the like.</p>
               <p>So that it plainly appears by what hath been ſaid, Glaſs muſt be known from great antiquity.

Theſe Ornaments cauſed many to deſire it, for not long after one is ſaid to have offered five hundred Crowns for it.

                  <p>Concerning the malleability of Glaſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Chymiſts build the poſſibility of making their <hi>Elixir,</hi> take their weak foundation from <hi>Pliny, lib. 36. cap. 26. They report,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that when Tiberius was Emperour, there was invented ſuch a temperament of Glaſs that it became flexible, and that the whole ſhop of the Artificer was demoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, leſt the prices ſhould be abated of the metalls of Braſs, Silver and Gold, and this report was more common than cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> Now <hi>Pliny</hi> liv'd in the time of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatian,</hi> who was the third Emperour from <hi>Tiberius,</hi> ſo that it appears this report conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued long. Many after him relate the ſame, though with ſome difference. <hi>Dion Caſſius, lib. 57.</hi> thus, <hi>At that time when a very great Portico at</hi> Rome <hi>inclin'd to one ſide, a certain Architect (whoſe name is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, becauſe</hi> Caeſar <hi>through envy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it to be regiſtred) ſtrangely ſet it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and ſo firm'd the foundations on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide, that it became immoveable;</hi> Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius <hi>having pai'd him baniſhed him the City, but he returning (as a ſupplicant) to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:53743:128"/>
the Prince, wittingly let fall a cup made of Glaſs, and when it was broken remade it with his hands, hoping thereby to obtain pardon; but for this very thing he was commanded to be put to death. Iſidorus</hi> affirms that the Emperour in a chafe hurl'd it upon the Pavement, which the Artiſt took up being batter'd, and folded like a veſſel of Braſs, he then took a Hammer out of his Boſom, and mended the Glaſs, which being done the Emperour ſaid to the Artiſt, <hi>doth any one elſe know this way of making Glaſs?</hi> when he had denyed it with an oath, <hi>Caeſar</hi> commanded his head to be cut off, left this being known, Gold ſhould be eſteemed as dirt, and the prices of all metalls ſhould be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And indeed if <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſſels of Glaſs did not break they would be better than Gold or Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Theſe three grave Authours, <hi>Pancirol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> and others follow, onely telling it as a hear-ſay; but <hi>Matheſius, Goclenius, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenſis, Quatriami, Libavius,</hi> and all the tribe of the Chymists, aſſert it with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, affirming that it was done by the vertue of the Elixir; but for all this confidence of theirs, <hi>Pliny</hi> onely relates this ſtory with a <hi>ſerunt,</hi> they report, and with a <hi>fama,</hi> the report was, and thirdly, <hi>crebrior quam certior,</hi>
                     <pb n="233" facs="tcp:53743:128"/>
more common than certain. Which thrice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of ſuch like words, ſufficiently argue his ſmall belief of the ſtory. It had been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have introduced this improbable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation the uſual way with a <hi>ferunt,</hi> and hereby ſufficiently have provided for his reputation, but he ſuperadds <hi>de proprio, fama crebrior, &amp;c.</hi> Which at most proves onely that ſome ſmall credit was by ſome few given to it, but <hi>ex vi verborum</hi> a disbelief in the wiſer ſort. For what can ſuch words as theſe <hi>(they ſay ſuch a thing, but the report is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain)</hi> import, but a diffidence in the relator? And 'twas but a <hi>fama,</hi> no Naturaliſt, Poet, nor Hiſtorian deliver it, no record of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor unuſual puniſhment, which is ſtrange, when their Books abound with obſervations of whatſoever rarely happened. And is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the Emperour himſelf ſhould not lay up this Glaſs as a ſecret in his choiceſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chives, and have tranſmitted it down to his ſucceſſors, as a thing worth the keeping, being the first of that nature ever made in the world, and perhaps the last, the Artiſt being put to death? And yet within a few years all this moſt rare invention, and ſtrange puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vaniſh into a report onely. All then was but <hi>vox populi</hi> and <hi>Romani</hi> too, nay, of the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:53743:129"/>
cruelty of a <hi>Nero</hi> too, all which might eaſily keep up this Fable. But why did <hi>Pliny</hi> then relate it Surely, to pleaſe and follow his <hi>genius,</hi> which was to commit to writing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was rare in Art and Nature, as his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew in his Epiſtles, and this preſent work witneſs. Now on this account he might take occaſion, in a thing perhaps he judged not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to commend that preſent age (ſhould af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times produce any ſuch effect,) and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the invention thereof to his own nation. Beſides 'twas but ſuch a temperament of Glaſs that rendred it flexible. And is it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible that after ages ſhould not light on't, eſpecially in a thing ſo commonly practiſed, and whereto ſo few, but two matterials onely are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired? Or what means, fame, by the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing of Gold and Silver? I confeſs I ſee no inconvenience to the Emperour, nor his Gold and Silvers value, by this invention, but many ways advantage, nor any force of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in <hi>Caeſars</hi> words. But ſo much of <hi>Plinyes</hi> testimony. And what ſhall the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers from him gain more reputation than the firſt relator gave it? Surely no, eſpecially ſince they have made ſuch a commentary on <hi>Plinys</hi> text the words will not bear, and have with additionals moulded it into a formal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:53743:129"/>
                     <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, <hi>ut flexibile eſſet,</hi> that it might be flexible. <hi>Dion</hi> comments, <hi>the man remade a broken Glaſs,</hi> One degree to mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leability, but <hi>Iſidorus</hi> completes it ſaying, <hi>with a Hammer he mended it.</hi> Hereby you may ſee the degrees how this opinion came into the world, and by what ſtrange piecings varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and interpretations, it hath been foment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make that ſeem credible to after ages, which <hi>Pliny</hi> relates as a vulgar tradition, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereto a cenſure of uncertainty. Which the Chymiſts to keep up the opinion of their Omnipotent Philoſophers ſtone, omit, and turn <hi>Plinys flexibility</hi> into <hi>malleability.</hi> As if there were no difference betwixt flexible and malleable. Whereas all bodies are in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, or other flexible, though none but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls malleable. A green ſtick, <hi>Muſcovie Glaſs,</hi> and infinite other things will bow very much, whereon the Hammer, notwithſtanding, hath no effect as to dilatation, and formation into thin plates, ſuch as things call'd properly malleable have. And that Glaſs is in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree flexible of it's ſelf 'tis apparent, for fine Cryſtall Glaſſes made very thin, and well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealed, will bear ſome ſmall, yet viſible bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And I have had <hi>Tubes</hi> made twelve foot long and longer for the <hi>Mercurial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,</hi>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:53743:130"/>
which being filled therewith would bend exceedingly. So that I am prone to think that if there were any thing at all in this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of <hi>Pliny</hi> it might be this, That where. as their Glaſs before this time was moſt brittle, as being made of Salt-peter, and the art of annealing it (not mentioned by <hi>Pliny</hi>) unknown and conſequently muſt break with the ſmalleſt force; Now this Artiſt might invent and ſhew ſuch Glaſs as might accidentally bear a fall, or greater force, than what was formerly made, by making it of <hi>Kali,</hi> and ſuperadding the way of annealing it. Which might give occaſion to fame, whereof <hi>Virgil, parva metu primo mox ſeſe attollit in auras,</hi> to add ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances (which is moſt common with the vulgar) and ſo to form this ſtory related by <hi>Pliny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as to the poſsibility of making Glaſs malleable, I find not one argument, beſides this report, unleſs by the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> who prove it per <hi>Circulum,</hi> reaſoning from their <hi>Elixir</hi> to Glaſs, and from Glaſs to the <hi>Elixir.</hi> And ſurely twere more feaſible to make the one than the other. For in the making of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixir</hi> the production is <hi>tale ens ex non tali ente,</hi> there being no reſiſtence, and incapacity in the matter <hi>ex qua.</hi> But in Glaſs quite
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:53743:130"/>
otherwiſe, for 'tis of it's own nature the moſt brittle thing in the world, and to make it <hi>malleable</hi> a quality quite contrary to it's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt be introduced. Beſides <hi>diaphaneity</hi> is a property not communicated to any thing <hi>malleable,</hi> and who would call that Glaſs, that were not tranſparent? As well may one name that Gold which is not ponderous nor <hi>malleable,</hi> as that Glaſs which is <hi>malleable</hi> and not tranſparent. Add hereunto, that the nature of <hi>malleability</hi> conſists in a cloſe and throughout adhaeſion of parts to parts, and a capacity to the change of figure in the minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt parts. Both which are inconſiſtent with the nature of Glaſs. For the matterials of Glaſs, Sand, and Salts, have ſuch figures as ſeem incapable of ſuch adhaeſion in every part one to another. For all ſalts have their determinate figure which they keep too, in their greateſt ſolutions and actions of the fire upon them, unleſs a total deſtruction be wrought upon them, as many inſtances might evince, and that figure is various according to the Salts. <hi>Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peter,</hi> and all <hi>Alcalizate-ſalts</hi> are pointed, and by their pungency, and cauſtickneſs ſeem to be made up of infinite ſharp pointed needles. And as for Sand the figure thereof is various, nay, infinite, as it appears in <hi>Microſcopes.</hi>
                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:53743:131"/>
Now how can any man imagine that ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of figures in Sand can ſo comply with the determinate figures of Salt as to touch one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>in minimis,</hi> which is neceſſary to make it <hi>malleable?</hi> Whereas to make it Glaſs 'tis enough that thoſe two touch one another at certain points onely, whereby ſuch an union is formed, which is neceſſary to denominate Glaſs, but wholly incompatible with <hi>malleability.</hi> And this union is that which makes in Glaſs Pores, from whence comes it's <hi>diaphaneity</hi> as you have heard from <hi>Lucret.</hi> Beſides ſomething ſaid before, declares that they both remain the ſame in the compound they were before. I ſhall conclude this argument, and ſay, that I conceive that nothing but the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixir</hi> will perform this effect, and that both of them will come into the world together.</p>

There are three ſorts of <hi>Furnaces</hi> as <hi>Agric. de re me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallica</hi> diſtinguiſheth them. The firſt the <hi>Calcar, fornax calcaria,</hi> is made in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of an Oven, ten foot long, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven broad, where wideſt, and two foot deep. On one ſide thereof, they have a trench about ſix inches ſquare, the upper part whereof is level with the ſurface of the <hi>Calcar,</hi> ſeparated onely from it at the mouth by bricks ſome nine inches wide. Into this trench they put their Sea-coal, the flame whereof paſſeth into all the parts of this <hi>Furnace,</hi> and reverberated from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the roof upon the <hi>Frit,</hi> over whoſe ſurface all the ſmoak flieth very black, and goeth out
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53743:132"/>
of the mouth of the <hi>Calcar.</hi> And the <hi>Conciator</hi> never ſtirs his <hi>Frit</hi> till the ſmoak is paſt. The Coals burn (as in other <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces</hi>) on Iron grates, and the aſhes fall thence into the aſhole, which is level with the floor. The <hi>Conciator</hi> (call'd in the Green-glaſs houſes the <hi>Founder</hi>) is he that weighs, and proportions the Salt, or aſhes, and Sand, and works them with a ſtrong fire till they run into lumps, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come white, and if the Metall be too hard, and conſequently brittle, he adds ſalt or aſhes, and if too ſoft, ſand, ſtill mixing them to a fit temper, which is onely known by the working of it. According as the <hi>Frit</hi> is prepared, he draws it out of the <hi>Calcar,</hi> and when 'tis cold lays it by for uſe. He doth not here caſt water upon the <hi>Frit,</hi> nor water it with Lee, as our <hi>Authour</hi> enjovns, and after ſome few days uſeth this <hi>Frit</hi> to make metall. Which when 'tis melted in the pots, in the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Furnace,</hi> with a <hi>ſquare,</hi> he rakes and ſtirs and mixeth well the Metall, when the <hi>ſquare</hi> is red hot, he puts it into a pail of water, for otherwiſe the Metall will ſtick to it. With a <hi>Ladle</hi> he takes out the <hi>Sandever,</hi> or empties the Metall from one
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53743:132"/>
pot into another. And with his <hi>Porteglo</hi> he ſcums the Glaſs, and with the <hi>Spiei</hi> (an Iron pointed and hooked at the end) he takes Metall out of the pots for proofs or Eſſays, to ſee whether the colour be good, and the Metall fit to work.

                  <p>The ſecond or working <hi>furnace</hi> is that where the pots are ſet, to which belong the fire place, and aſh-hole.

                  <p>Two ſorts of pots are uſed in <hi>Cryſtal fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces,</hi> a greater which will hold three or four hundred weight of Metall, theſe are an inch thick, and at the bottom, neer two, deep two foot, and above twenty inches broad at the top, but much nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower at the bottom.

The <hi>Servitor</hi> when the Metall is ſufficiently refined, puts his hollow Iron into the pot, and turning it about, takes out enough for the veſſel or work 'tis intended for, the Mettal ſticks to the Iron like ſome glutinous, or clammy juice, much like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:53743:135"/>
taken by tradeſmen out of their pots. The figure it takes on the Iron, is roundiſh, and whil'ſt 'tis red hot the <hi>Servitor</hi> rouls it to and fro on a Marble that the parts thereof may be more firmly united; And then gently blowing into his hollow Iron rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Metall juſt as blowing doth a bladder or glove. As often as he blows into the Iron (and that muſt be very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) ſo often he removes ſuddenly the Iron from his mouth to his cheek, leſt he ſhould draw the flame into his mouth, when he reapplies it to the Iron. Then he takes his Iron and whirls it many times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his head, and ſo lengthens and cools the Glaſs, and if it be needful for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, moulds in the <hi>ſtampirons</hi> or flats the <hi>bottom</hi> by preſsing it on the Marble; And then delivers it to the Maſter workman, who with a gentle force breaks of the <hi>col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> (which is that part of the Glaſs which cleaved to the <hi>blowing Iron,</hi> and caſts by to make Green Glaſs) and with his <hi>ponteglo</hi> ſticks the Glaſs and ſcalds it, and with his <hi>paſsago</hi> makes the boul of the Glaſs, then with his <hi>procello</hi> widens and makes it hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower and more capacious, and with the <hi>ſhears</hi> cuts off what's ſuperfluous, and
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:53743:136"/>
withall making it plain and even. And thus with <hi>blowing, preſsing, ſcalding</hi> (which muſt be repeated as often as the Glaſs cools) <hi>amplyfying, cutting,</hi> &amp;c. frames it into the ſhape preconceived in his mind. And when need requires faſtens on feet and handles, and with the <hi>Spiei</hi> puts on <hi>Riga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi> and <hi>Marblings,</hi> and when the Maſter finiſheth them another <hi>Servitor</hi> takes them, with an Iron fork, and ſpeedily placeth them in the <hi>tower</hi> to anneal, mounting up by a ſtep for the more convenient placing of them, unleſs by a ſtumble in the way he chance to break this ware, then moſt brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and tender, nay, that will break of it's ſelf without this annealing. So many Maſters as there are ſo many pots at leaſt, and ſo many <hi>Boccas</hi> or holes there muſt be, for each man hath his proper ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Where they receive thoſe ſcorching heats ſallying directly into their faces, mouths and lungs, whence they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to work in their ſhirts like the <hi>Cyclopes</hi> and <hi>nudi membra Pyracmons,</hi> with a ſtraw broad brim'd Hat on their heads to defend their eyes from excedency of heat and light. They ſit in wooden large and wide Chairs with two long Elbows,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:53743:136"/>
whereon they hang their inſtruments, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo that 'tis immoveable. They work ſix hours at a time meaſured by one Glaſs onely, and then others ſucceed them, and when theſe latter have wrought their ſix hours the former return to their labour, and by this means the <hi>furnaces</hi> are never idle, whil'ſt they are in good condition, and the pots break not, and the fire keeps the Metall in <hi>fuſion. Libavius</hi> obſerves that they are for the moſt part pale, thirſty, and not very long lived, by reaſon of their <hi>colliquations,</hi> and the diſeaſes of their head and breaſt, &amp; that having their bodies weak, they are ſoon fudled with wine or bear.

               <p>HAving now diſpatched what was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be premiſed, we come to the text it's ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polverine or Rochetta,</hi> are the ſame thing, and are nothing more than aſhes extracted from the ſame plant, but differing in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as appears by our Author in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The name of the latter is wholly unknown to our Glaſs-houſes, and hath now no diſtinction at <hi>Moran</hi> it's ſelf. The name of <hi>Polverine</hi> ſtill is kept, and 'tis given to all aſhes which come from the <hi>Levant</hi> to make Glaſſes with. The reaſon then of their different<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> names ſeems to be, that the <hi>Polverine</hi> was that which was brought in ſmall powder, and the other in hard pieces or ſtones, and therefore named <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetta.</hi> And indeed the workmen obſerve that the harder and bigger lumps yield a whiter and ſtronger ſalt than that which comes over in ſmall pieces or powder. And whether
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53743:137"/>
this proceeds from the different ſorts of this kind of plant, or the ſeaſons of their growth, gathering and burning, or from ſome ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from other ſalts mixed therewith, or rather from Sea-ſalt water, or other moyſture which much endammageth them, I determine not. But certain it is, that to make the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſalt, and ſuch as will come into hard and ſtony lumps, they make a Lee of their firſt burnt aſhes, and therewith water the herbs to be next burnt, and ſo water the herbs with new Lees at every burning, and this will make a moſt ſtrong pot aſhes for Soap-boylers, and Dyers. Which way whether it hath been practiſed to make <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chetta,</hi> and now omitted I cannot affirm.</p>
               <p>Comes from the <hi>Levant</hi> and <hi>Syria. Syria</hi> is part of the <hi>Levant.</hi> Now theſe aſhes are brought from <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Tripoly.</hi>

Soda, Salicornia,</hi> and <hi>Salſola</hi> manifeſtly derive their name <hi>à Sale</hi> from <hi>Salt,</hi> wherewith they all exceedingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound. Of the Antiquity of knowledge, and names of this plant with us, thus our learned Countrey-man Dr. <hi>Turner</hi> in his <hi>Herbal.</hi> As I remember it hath no name in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and though it be very plenteous in many places of <hi>England,</hi> yet I could never meet with any man that knew it; But leſt this herb ſhould be without a name, it may be called <hi>Salt-Wurt,</hi> becauſe it is ſalt in taſt, and <hi>Glaſs-weed,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the aſhes of it ſerve to make glaſs with. <hi>Parkinſon</hi> ſaith, that 'tis call'd by the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of our Sea-coast, <hi>Frog-graſs,</hi> and <hi>Crab-graſs,</hi> perhaps becauſe thoſe animals feed thereon, being a very juicy, ſubſtantial, and not of an unpleaſant ſaltiſh taſt. <hi>Gaſpar Bauhin</hi> in his <hi>Pinax</hi> makes ten ſorts thereof, whoſe names and deſcriptions we omit, as too long for this place. I ſhall onely mention thoſe three wherewith the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> and other <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> make their <hi>Polverine</hi> for Glaſs, and Soap, as <hi>Alpinus chap. 42.</hi> delivers them. The firſt is <hi>Kali geniculatum,</hi> the ſecond ſort
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53743:138"/>
                  <hi>Kali ſecunda ſpecies,</hi> and <hi>Anthyllis qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſdam,</hi> by <hi>Alpin.</hi> but by <hi>Columna Kali Florid. repens Neapolitanum,</hi> who found it at <hi>Naples,</hi> and figures, and deſcribes it, and ſaith 'tis uſed to make Glaſs. The third ſort more peculiar to <hi>Egypt</hi> is call'd by the ſame Author <hi>Kali Egyptiacum foliis valde lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis hirſutis.</hi> And beſides theſe three, I have ſeen, and have by me a fourth, taken from their <hi>Polverine</hi> bags call'd <hi>Kali ſpinoſum</hi> by the Herbariſts. The firſt and laſt of theſe (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the <hi>minus</hi> and <hi>minimum) our river</hi> Thames, and <hi>Sea-coaſts</hi> affords in great plenty, but in no Countrey more <hi>Northerly</hi> than <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> yet ours will not make aſhes for Cryſtall, or any other ſort of Glaſs, as an experiment made at the <hi>Glaſs-houſe</hi> taught me, for ours being put upon an Iron heated red hot ſmoaked all away, leaving little or no aſhes at all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But the <hi>Kalies</hi> brought from the <hi>Levant,</hi> put on the ſame Iron, ſoon converted almoſt all of them into a very ſaltiſh aſhes of a dark aſh their proper colour, theſe in burning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted themſelves like worms, flame long, and make a white and very ſtrong ſalt.

This great difference of plants in reſpect of the countrey may be manifeſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in many other plants as well as in theſe <hi>Kalies.</hi> As in <hi>Tobaccoes</hi> ariſing from the ſame ſeed, and in <hi>Canary</hi> and <hi>Rheniſh</hi> wines from the ſame ſtock, in the <hi>Hemlocks</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> and thoſe of other countries, and in multitude of other examples, and this reaſon differenceth <hi>Polverine</hi> and <hi>Barillia.</hi> Theſe <hi>Kalies</hi> though natural denizens of the water, and flouriſhing naturally neer ſalt lakes, yet are planted on land in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> which doubtleſs contributes much in thoſe hot regions (eſpecially in <hi>Egypt</hi> where no rain falls, but the Countrey is onely watered once a year, by the riſing of the river <hi>Nile,</hi> leaving much fatneſs and ſoil behind it) to the quantity, ſtrength, and fixedneſs of the ſalt. Now theſe <hi>Kalies</hi> about midſummer, when in their full ſtrength, are cut down and dryed in the Sun, and then burned, being laid in cocks or piles, either upon the ground, or upon Iron grates, the aſhes whereof fall thence into
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53743:139"/>
a pit where they grow into a hard maſs or ſtone, &amp; are gathered and laid up for uſe, &amp; are call'd <hi>Sode</hi> as <hi>Lobel</hi> affirms. When theſe plants were firſt taken notice of is uncertain. The firſt that took notice of them, and gave them their name, were the <hi>Arabians,</hi> as alſo to their ſalt, as appears by their addition <hi>Al</hi> which is purely <hi>Arabick.</hi> Amongſt them I find it mentioned by <hi>Serapio</hi> and <hi>Aviden</hi> the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, who both commend it for the Stone, ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and diſeaſes of the eyes. <hi>Lobel</hi> thinks that we owe the plant, name, and way to make the Salt to the latter <hi>Graecians</hi> or <hi>Arabian</hi> Philoſophers Chymiſts that wrought in Glaſs. <hi>Adverſ. pag. 169.</hi> But as to the <hi>Graecians,</hi> and their knowledge of it, I cannot conſent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis not mentioned by any of the <hi>Greek</hi> Phyſicians or other writers, beſides it hath not yet attained any name in that language, and therefore doubtleſs the <hi>Arabians</hi> of latter times have conveyed the knowledge thereof to us.</p>

And for the ſame cauſe the <hi>Tartar</hi> muſt be diſſolved in the water before the <hi>Polverine</hi> is put into the boyler. They <hi>Calcine</hi> their <hi>Tartar</hi> in an Oven, neer the <hi>Leer,</hi> in the ſpace of ſix hours, and that to whiteneſs too, finding that this hath a better effect, than a meaner calcination hath. What advantage the drawing off the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity of the <hi>Tartar</hi> gives, a ſecret way u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſome <hi>Chymiſts</hi> doth demonſtrate. To make their <hi>Cryſtals</hi> and <hi>Cream</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> larger, and whiter, they powder it groſly, and then <hi>Calcine,</hi> or rather dry it throughly in an

Oven, in tin pans. And thus they make them much better, than they can be made without this drying, or moderate <hi>Calcination.</hi>

Sand for Glaſs, which when many ſhips com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming together have exhauſted, the ſame place is preſently filled again.

Now theſe aſhes are to be made of old trees, whoſe trunk when grown to ſix foot high is hollowed, and fire being put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cavity, the whole tree is burnt down and turn'd to aſhes. This is done in the winter, when the ſnows have long continued, or in the Summer when it ſnoweth not.

And certainly were it either of theſe or any natural colour it could not but have been taken notice of by ſome writer on theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, being a thing ſo commonly uſed, and ſo much thereof ſpent in Glaſs and Pottery.

kept by them as a ſecret. And if I might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture at it, I ſhould think that 'twere a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Braſs and Sand, and perhaps ſome <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> added thereunto. The Blew colour it gives, induceth me to think, that 'tis from Braſs, as the colour of <hi>Manganeſe</hi> is from Iron: for certainly nothing can give a tincture to Glaſs, but what is metalline, and all metalls do give a tincture thereunto. <hi>Lapis Lazuli</hi> a very hard ſtone loſeth it's colour in the fire, and ſo do other pretious ſtones. 'Tis true, <hi>Antimony</hi> gives Glaſs a colour, but 'tis by reaſon of it's Metalline part the <hi>Regulus</hi> onely. Much leſs will any ſort of earths bear the ſtrong heat of their furnaces. For though <hi>Scots-ochre</hi> and <hi>India-red,</hi> may be both cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd into good colours for the uſes they are emploi'd for, yet in the Glaſs furnaces they wholly loſe them.

For though ſilver be ſaid to afford this colour, yet that pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And thirdly, the reaſon I ſuppoſe that <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt therewith, is, becauſe neither <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> nor ſpirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> poured on the <hi>Zaffer,</hi> have any operation ſenſible thereupon, either as to raiſing bubles, ſolution, or tincture. Both which experiments I tryed with ordinary <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> and ſpirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and could not perceive the leaſt buble ariſe, nor ſmalleſt motion of theſe liquours, nor any tincture in either, nor hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing noiſe, which hapneth in the ſolution of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline bodies. But that the <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> hinders the ſolution &amp; conſequences thereof will be manifeſt by an experiment we ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently produce.

A judgement not unlike this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:53743:154"/>
I find in <hi>Ariſt.</hi> where he ſheweth the force of <hi>Origanum</hi> to purge wine. But this Iron ſubſtance exhales not, if it be mixed with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, becauſe then 'tis baked with leſs fire or a leſs time. And this is all we have delivered concerning this <hi>Manganeſe.</hi> Now in theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, two things are obſervable, the attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and purgation. As for the former, attraction of the liquour of Glaſs, there's no ground for it, no more than the bare name imports, which was impoſed <hi>ex placito:</hi> For if you apply never ſo great a quantity of <hi>Manganeſe</hi> to the ſmalleſt particle of broken or melted Glaſs, it stirs it not. And then if they mean by the liquour of Glaſs the <hi>Sandever</hi> part thereof, 'tis certain the greeniſh colour remains in the metall after that is wholly ſcummed off, and that <hi>Manga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> then put in refines it. But if they mean by liquour of Glaſs onely liquid Glaſs, then 'tis onely <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> no argument, no experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being brought to prove it. As for that of purifying 'tis as manifeſt as the attraction is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure. Though the <hi>modus</hi> be very doubtful. <hi>Scaliger</hi> and his Maſter <hi>Secundus</hi> think 'tis by the way of exhalation, and perhaps, <hi>Plin. &amp; Caeſalp.</hi> mean by their attraction, this purgation, but then they tell us not what becomes of them both. They must be ſeparated from the metall by
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:53743:155"/>
precipitation or exhalation, but the former can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, for then the metall being ſtir'd twould return to it's former colour, or 'twould be found in the bottom of the pot in the form of powder, as in other precipitations 'tis conſtantly uſual. And the exhalation is as incredible ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The reaſon ſeems to me to be onely a change in the figure and minuteſt parts of the metall, for the fire ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>Manganeſe</hi> run, mixeth it with the ſmalleſt <hi>atoms</hi> of the metall throughout, which by boyling, and various agitation and revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them frames thoſe <hi>atomical figures</hi> which are apt to reflect moſt of the light which falls upon it, and is the ſame we call White. Multitude of inſtances might be given to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate this doctrine of the production of colours by mere tranſmutation of parts, but we ſhall content our ſelves with thoſe onely which by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of colourate bodies become White. Take then <hi>Terebinthine</hi> which is of a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh

colour, or <hi>Oleum Capevae</hi> of a blackiſh colour, or tinge oil of <hi>Turpentine</hi> with <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degreas</hi> (in which 'twill eaſily diſſolve) into as full a Green as the natural colour of Glaſs, and ſhake either of theſe very well together, with the yolks of Eggs, and they all make a very clear and white colour. Or elſe take a ſtrong <hi>lixivium</hi> of the <hi>Soap-boilers;</hi> and mix it by agitation with the Greeniſh oyl of Elder, and you ſhall therewith make that medicine Phyſicians call <hi>Lac.

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:53743:156"/>
a coloured metal? or why <hi>Zaffer</hi> and <hi>Manganeſe</hi> ſhould produce a Black?</p>
               <p>That <hi>Manganeſe</hi> conſiſts of much Iron ſeems beyond contradiction, which may be evinced by theſe experiments. I poured <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome powder of it, and in a narrow mouth'd Glaſs, the water roſe up in great bubles, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately boiled over the Glaſs, and in a Glaſs, with a wider mouth it roſe leſs, and a ſtrong, and moſt piercing fume there from, offended much my Noſe-thrils. And Spirit of <hi>Vitriol</hi> poured on it boild a little, but ſparkled more, the glaſs became ſo hot that I could not hold it in my band, and that which ſeems peculiar to the <hi>Manganeſe,</hi> fair water poured thereon encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the decaying heat very much. The tincture of this ſtone was of a deep claret colour. All which agree throughout with the ſame Spirits poured on Iron; and certainly the colours of the <hi>Manganeſe,</hi> come from the Iron that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Red is common to them both, and a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is but a deeper Red with an eye of Blew, and the ſame colour ſome preparations of <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> have, and as black is made with <hi>Zaffer</hi> and <hi>Manganeſe,</hi> ſo rich Blacks in ſilks are made of ſlip, that is the powder which the <hi>Shear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grinders</hi> grind from ſhears and other edge tools mixed with Sand from the Grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:53743:156"/>
and doubtleſs would be of uſe in the colour pots of the furnace did they know it, and would they uſe it. Secondly, this <hi>Manganeſe</hi> makes the metall riſe and boil as all Iron or Steel alone, or <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> or any other prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or compoſition thereof, which quality is alſo common to <hi>Copper, Braſs</hi> and <hi>Lead.</hi> Obſerve here, that whereſoever any of theſe are put into the pot our Author commands that it be done leaſurely and by little and little, and that ſome vacuity be left in the pot, for fear you loſe your metall which will run into the fire and aſhes, and thereby you loſe the time and charge, for all this commonly goes together with him.</p>
               <p>Our Author here commends <hi>Manganeſe</hi> of <hi>Piemont,</hi> for the beſt in the world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wherever he mentions the one, he ſubjoyne the other.

               </p>
               <p>The two moſt eminent and ſingular colours, both in themſelves, and in relation to animals, and to this Art of Glaſs, are Blew and Green<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in themſelves, as partaking much of light, as is ſeen in the Triangular-Glaſſes, and they are alſo moſt delightful and agreeable to the ſight, and eyes of animals as neither widening nor contracting the Pupil too much, both which are dolorous and offenſive; and in the Art of Glaſs, in Pasts, Enamels, Glaſs of Lead by reaſon of their great conformity and neerneſs to many ſort of gems, challenge a great ſhare of uſe, beſides the many gradations of them uſed ſimply of themſelves, or elſe blended and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one with the other. Blew is a ſimple colour in all Arts converſant about it, but Green in the curious Art of dying is a compounded co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:53743:158"/>
of Blew the Ground, and Yellow ſuper-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, or contrary-wiſe wrought. But in other Arts this colour is ſimple, and both ariſe from the ſame materiall <hi>Copper</hi> or <hi>Braſs</hi> by various ordering and preparing them. 'Tis a ſtrange and great myſtery to ſee how ſmall and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcernable a nicety (though the ſame materialls be uſed) makes the one and the other colour, as is daily diſcovered by the reſiners in making their <hi>Verditers,</hi> who ſometimes with the ſame materials, and quantities of them for their <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> and with the ſame <hi>Copper-Plates,</hi> and Whiting make a very fair Blew <hi>Verditer,</hi> otherwhiles a fairer or more dirty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green. Whereof they can aſſign no reaſon, nor can they hit on a certain rule to make conſtantly their <hi>Verditer</hi> of a fair Blew, to their great diſprofit, the Blew being of manifold greater value than the Green. Now although the <hi>gènuine</hi> and natural colour of <hi>Braſs</hi> and <hi>Copper,</hi> is the true Sea green, mixed of both colours, yet the former inclines more to a Blew than the latter, and the diſſolvents have a great ſhare in this buſineſs. For <hi>Verdigreas</hi> made of <hi>Copper-plates</hi> buried in the earth with Grapes, makes a Green, but <hi>Copperas</hi> made with <hi>Copper,</hi> and the liquour of the <hi>Pyrites</hi> diſſolved with rain water, yields a
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:53743:158"/>
Blew in <hi>Dantzick</hi> and <hi>Hungarian,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Vitriol,</hi> the onely difference of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the reſolution of the materials into finer &amp; minuter Particles, and various tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Atomical</hi> parts of the materials diſſolved. Now the reaſon why <hi>Braſs</hi> makes a better Blew than <hi>Copper,</hi> ſeems to be this, that the <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> the onely thing that differenceth them, takes in, and incorporates with it's ſelf that acidity which naturally <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> contains, which as it appears in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Verdigreas</hi> turns it to a Green, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exalted by the acidity of the Grapes. And this ſeems alſo to be the cauſe, why <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine-grapes,</hi> which have more acidity in them than <hi>Spaniſh-wine-grapes</hi> have (though the climate of <hi>Spain</hi> be more ſuitable than that of <hi>France</hi>) are fitteſt to work this effect. The force alſo of <hi>Vitriolate</hi> juyces may be ſeen in our <hi>Engliſh Copperas,</hi> and <hi>Vitriol</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> made of <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Steel,</hi> both which change the natural Yellowiſh colour of Iron into a Green, and <hi>Lapis Armenus</hi> a Blew ſtone ground with Vineger, or the tincture thereof drawn. The effect of <hi>Calaminaris</hi> in drinking in the acidity of the <hi>Vitriol</hi> do the ſame, an ingredient into <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> is clearly manifeſted, by a pretty and lucid expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:53743:159"/>
was once ſhewed me by my neighbour a Refiner, who bought ſome <hi>Copper-plates</hi> to draw down his ſilver from <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 'twas diſſolvèd, but theſe <hi>Copper-plates</hi> would not wholy praecipitate the ſaid ſilver, but left ten pound thereof in thirty remaining unpraecipitated in the water. The reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was found to be, becauſe the <hi>Copper</hi> for thoſe plates had been melted in a pot, wherein <hi>Braſs</hi> before had ſuffered <hi>Fuſion.</hi> The <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-ſmith,</hi> hereupon remelted the ſaid plates in new pots, and with a ſtrong fire, burnt off (as they uſually do) the flours of the <hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> which are volatil and fly about the work-houſe, colouring the Cloaths, hairs, and Beards of the Work-men, as white as thoſe of Meal-men, or Millers. Now when theſe flours had been well ſeparated, and the <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-plates</hi> freed totally from them, they drew down the ſilver wholly from the <hi>Aqua-fortis.</hi> Now in this experiment the <hi>Lapis Calamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> imbibed part of the acidity from the <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peras,</hi> and ſo the Plates being leſs corroded, and conſequently too little thereof received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the parting water, left room for the ſilver to remain, and to be ſupported by the ſaid water which is the reaſon of all praecipitation, for the new advenient metall coming into the place of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:53743:159"/>
the ſilver, forceth it to deſcend upon the Boule and Plates in the form of a White powder. But that this effect followed from the imbibition of the acidity from the <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> ſeems mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, becauſe <hi>Aqua-fortis-vineger,</hi> or it's <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> or any other acid juyce, poured thereon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more ſweet, and heavy, as they do with <hi>Coral, Crabs-eyes,</hi> (as they are falſly call'd) the ſhells of fiſhes or <hi>Lapis Lyncis,</hi> and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wherewith &amp; the water from the <hi>Copper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates Verditer</hi> is made, likewiſe do. And hence it proceeded too that the water made with theſe Plates, acquired the moſt ſingular Sky<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour the ſaid Refiner had ever ſeen. And to this purpoſe I remember, that from Braſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in common <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> with an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Crabs-eyes,</hi> a moſt fair Sky colour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded thence.</p>
               <p>Of all metalls <hi>Copper</hi> is the moſt plyable to the Hammer, drawing into wire, gives mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leability to ſilver and gold in coins, and is of no hard ſolution in the fire, is ſoon corroded with any acid Spirits or Salts, and without great difficulty is reſolved into a powder with the fire.

And this I the rather relate, becauſe I have not met with any experiment in this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with volatile Salts, and 'tis very probable that other plants full of the ſame Salt, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally having ſome clammy juyce in them, ſuch as Onions, Garlick, Leeks, and Molyes have, might ſhew ſome rare effect upon <hi>Copper,</hi> for their leaves have either a deep Green, or elſe a Green mixt with Blew. The whole tribe of <hi>Acids</hi> alſo are diſſolvents of <hi>Copper,</hi> and all ſorts of fixed ſalts, all which have acidity in them. And no doubt great variety might be met withall in diverſity of menſtruums, and proceſſes of extracting theſe tinctures.</p>
               <p>Our Author <hi>c. 20.</hi> tells you Braſs is made of <hi>Copper</hi> and <hi>Lapis Calaminaris,</hi> I ſhall here deliver the proceſs ſince I find it no where fully delivered, <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> is found in <hi>Sommerſetſhire,</hi> and the North of <hi>Wales,</hi> and though ſome of it hath been brought from <hi>Dantzick,</hi> yet 'tis not of the ſame goodneſs with ours of <hi>England.</hi> This ſtone before uſed muſt have the following preparation. It muſt be firſt calcin'd in a furnace like the <hi>Calcar</hi> with a ſmall hole on one ſide to put fire in, which may be either of Coal or Wood, but Wood is heſt, becauſe it maketh the greateſt flame, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:53743:162"/>
the beſt reverberation. The time of Calcination is about five hours, in which ſpace they often rake it about with a great Iron rake, It requireth good judgement to calcine it well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for when 'tis not ſufficiently calcin'd 'twill not mix with the <hi>Copper,</hi> and when too much, 'twill make it too brittle, and in both caſes gives not the true tincture to <hi>Copper.</hi> The ſign of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s juſt calcination is, when 'tis in a white and very fine powder. Almoſt half of the <hi>Calamie</hi> (as the workmen call it) is wasted and flies away in flour, which ſticks to the mouth of the Furnace of divers colours of little uſe with them, though I could eaſily prove theſe flours to be the true pompholix of the ancients, and to be uſed in the ointment, that hath it's denomination thence. 'Tis an excellent dryer, and applyed to Gleeting Nerves, and Tendons, without pain, it ſoon exiccateth them. This pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I communicated to the eternal glory of our nation, and <hi>Anatomy,</hi> &amp; an excellent Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian, and never to be by me forgotten the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> a man moſt curious in all natural things, who confeſſed he thought this to be the ſaid <hi>Pompholix,</hi> and with most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſucceſs frequently uſed it. Now when the Calamie is well calcind, they grind and ſerce it to a very fine powder, and therewith mix well
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:53743:162"/>
                  <hi>Gharcoal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> finely ground to a powder, this mixture they put into the bottom of a pot, and upon it a <hi>Copper-plate,</hi> to wit, ſeven pound of this mixture, to five pound of <hi>Copper,</hi> which is their uſual proportion. Theſe pots are made of <hi>Nonſuch-clay,</hi> which must be first calcin'd if they make pots of it alone, but uſually they grind their broken pots with an equall quantity of the clay, and therewith make them, which being well wrought and annealed, will commonly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> laſt 12 or 14 days.</p>
               <p>The furnace wherein they melt their <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> and <hi>Calamie</hi> is about ſix or ſeven foot deep under ground, the earth being circularly raiſed by degrees from the plain of the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe to the hole, whereby the materials and fire are put into the furnace, which is the center of the raiſed earth, and in a perpendicular to the bottom, and area of the furnace. The diameter whereof at the bottom is three or four foot wide, growing gradually narrower and narrower in the form of a cone to the ſaid hole which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a foot in diameter, wide enough to put in and take out their pots and fire. This hole hath an Iron cover with a ſmall hole in it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they regulate their fires. At the bottom of this furnace, they have a long pipe or hollow
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:53743:163"/>
place by which they blow their fire with bellows. At firſt they make a very gentle fire, encreaſing it by degrees, till they ſee the <hi>Copper</hi> melted down, and well mixed with the <hi>Calamie,</hi> which is uſually done in the ſpace of twelve hours, for every twelve hours, they caſt their plates at five in the morning and evening; and then they take their pots out of the furnace (which are uſually eight or ten in number) with a long pair of tongues, and ſet them in a hot place a little time till the metal grows a little cooler, yet ſtill melted, and then pour it out of all the pots together into a mould of ſtone, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a plate of Braſs three foot long, and a foot and a half wide weighing betwixt 60 and 80 pound. The mould is made of two ſtones which ſeem to me to be of that ſort, which are call'd <hi>Calcarii,</hi> for they have many ſmall ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning particles in them like Spars, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue after long uſe of theſe ſtones, whoſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is thereby changed from a Gray to a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh <hi>Copper</hi> colour, onely the ſpots remaining. Theſe ſtones have formerly been brought from <hi>Holland,</hi> but have been ſometimes ſince found in the mountanous parts of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and are as big as a reaſonable graveſtone, and of the ſame figure. They muſt be annealed ſome hours before they caſt their plates on them, elſe the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:53743:163"/>
metall will fly, and beſides endanger their breaking. They muſt have many pair of them in readineſs, becauſe after three days caſting they become weary (as they call it) and muſt be new coated with coal and tallow. 'Tis to be obſerved that the mixture of the <hi>Calamie</hi> and Coal, must be always put under the <hi>Copper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates,</hi> for then the <hi>Calamie</hi> being raiſed by the mixt <hi>Charcoal</hi> and heat of the furnace eaſily penetrateth and mixeth by little and little with the <hi>Copper</hi> melted, and ſo both unite into one maſs, making the compound call'd <hi>Braſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> whereas the <hi>Calamie</hi> would moſt of it fly away ſhould it be put above the <hi>Copper-plates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And though the interpoſition of the <hi>Copper</hi> hinder it's aſcent, yet much thereof flyes away and ſticks to the ſides of the furnace, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diverſity of the ſuperior or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior part of the furnace where 'tis found and difference in figure and colour receives va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious names, of <hi>Capnitis, Botrytis, Placitis, Onychitis, Oſtracitis,</hi> ſo call'd by <hi>Plin. l. 34. c. 10.</hi> All which contain ſome <hi>Copper</hi> in them eaſily diſcoverable by the affuſion of <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> on them or by long lying expoſed to the open air, nay, you ſhall ſee in them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Greeniſh Blewiſh colour, when they are taken out of the furnace. The encreaſe of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:53743:164"/>
weight by the <hi>Calamie</hi> is from 38 to 40 pound in the hundred, ſo that 60 pound of <hi>Copper</hi> makes with <hi>Calamie</hi> 100 pound of <hi>Braſs.</hi> Obſerve alſo that the fire muſt not be too ſtrong, or muſt the pots continue too long in the furnace after fuſion of the <hi>Copper</hi> leſt the <hi>Calamie</hi> fly away, and that the coals lying at the bottom of the pot, and which were mixed with the <hi>Calamie</hi> are not totally turned to aſhes, but oftentimes come out untouched, and unaltered, though the pots have continued red hot for many hours together, which is needful becauſe <hi>Copper</hi> with the <hi>Calamie</hi> require longer time to be melted then <hi>Copper</hi> alone doth. As to the eaſie parting of the <hi>Calamie</hi> from the metall, we ſhall to what hath been formerly ſaid, add this, that when they draw this <hi>Braſs</hi> into <hi>Wire,</hi> at each new drawing they muſt anneal it elſe 'twill hreak, and yet they must not heat it to above a <hi>Cherry</hi> red, for if they do they burn of the <hi>Calamie</hi> to their great loſs, which is eaſily done in <hi>Braſs</hi> drawn into ſmall threads.</p>

colouring materials, though not all their prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are uſed in each of the three ways, <hi>viz. Zaffer, Manganeſe, Silver, Steel, Smalts</hi> and <hi>Lead.</hi> Secondly, the greater variety of ingredients, makes the better <hi>Calcidony,</hi> for the firſt is more ſimple than the ſecond, and the ſecond than the third, and our Author com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the laſt before the ſecond, and that before the firſt. Thirdly, that ſome ingredients there are in each of them which contribute no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour at all to the metall, ſuch are <hi>Tartar, Soot, Sal Armoniac, Mercury.</hi> Fourthly, that ſome of them are of an unctuous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>Lead, Soor, Tartar</hi> and <hi>Smalts,</hi> which may hinder the union of the materials one with another, which appears by this, that they do part one from another, and therefore the metall being taken when it begins to grow cold, will then ſhew ſome waves, and divers colours very fair, <hi>chap. 42.</hi> A great deal of Art there is in working the metall at a due heat, and in the manner alſo, and in this latter much of Art lyeth as it doth alſo in marbling Paper.</p>

                  <hi>Lead returning into it's body, breaks out the bottom of the pots.</hi> Lead can hardly be ſo well calcin'd, but ſome particles thereof will remain uncalcind, which the heat of the furnace reduceth to <hi>Lead</hi> again, the ſame was ſaid of <hi>Ceruſs</hi> before, and the like you ſhall find in <hi>Minium,</hi> the higheſt calcination uſed thereof. Now the cauſe why it breaks out the bottom of the pots ſeems to be, that receiving there a new calcination, and cloſing with it's unctuoſity, and body the pores of the pots, it hinders the paſſages of the fire into the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, which impeded, converts all it's force upon the clay, whereof the pots are made, and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:53743:172"/>
by farther calcining it muſt neceſſrily make holes in them; Now that <hi>Lead</hi> doth ſink into, and not as other metals continue melted on the ſurface of the pots 'tis manifeſt by the refiners teſts, and Gold-ſmiths coples, which ſhew by their colour and weight, what body they have received into them, and by their remelting and reduction of the <hi>Lead.</hi> 'Tis true the teſts do imbibe ſome Silver, and therefore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melt them in the great heat of the <hi>Almond Furnaces,</hi> and no doubt the ſame happens to the coples, though the <hi>Eſſay Maſters</hi> of the Tower ſtrongly aſſert the contrary againſt the importers of <hi>Bullion,</hi> But the <hi>Eſſay Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> at <hi>Gold-ſmiths-hall</hi> do gain Silver from theſe coples by melting them down. But in this caſe ſome minute parts of Silver onely get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the teſts and coples by the mediation of the <hi>Lead</hi> alone, ſince <hi>Lead</hi> is uſed in both refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Eſſays. But Silver alone nor other metall will at all ſink into the teſt. Another reaſon of this Accident, may be that the <hi>Lead</hi> inſinuating it's ſelf into the pores of the pots, and continued there in fuſion, will by getting farther and father by it's weight into the bottom of the pot at laſt run out and then leave holes for the metall to follow.</p>

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:53743:175"/>
pot, for ſo the balls will ſomewhat melt, and ſtick one to another, let them then be finely pounded &amp; a Lee made thereof, which congele to a Salt. And in this Lee let the <hi>Cryſtalls</hi> be ſo often, and ſo long extinguiſhed, till you can rub them to powder, betwixt your fingers. This being done, let ſome of the remaining ſalt be ſo often purified by ſolution, coagulation, and calcination, till no feces at all appear in the ſolution. Take then of purified ſalt of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> two parts, of the foregoing ſalt prepared, part one, melt them together. This will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all the colours of the whole world, and appears like Oriental gems. Chymical Authors generally prepare <hi>Cryſtall</hi> this way, onely ſome extinguiſh it in Vineger inſtead of fair water, you may eaſily know the beſt way, by the diſcourſe concerning the Glaſs drops, which is to follow, and doubtleſs the beſt way, were to extinguiſh it often in a strong Lee.</p>
               <p>The making of theſe <hi>Paſts</hi> differs nothing from that of Glaſs, but that <hi>Paſts</hi> are made of <hi>Cryſtall</hi> prepared, as the other of <hi>Cryſtall</hi> metall, the colours in both are the ſame.

The manner of making it is this, Take very thin plates of lead, or rather that which hath been long in Glaſs Windows, and diſſolve it in <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> (good water neer diſſolves as much as it's own weight) and the diſſolved <hi>Lead</hi> will ſoon become a <hi>Sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charum</hi> in the bottom of the Glaſs.

When they are caſt into molds they muſt be poliſhed and ſmoothed, that the reflected Ray may bring with it the reſemblance of things, and imitate a Looking Glaſs. Whereunto the ſmoothneſs and fitneſs of the parts much conduceth. If the mixture be not ſmooth enough, cut or grind it, that on one ſide the image repreſented may be bigger, and on the other leſs, and different. If it be rough apply it to the wheel, where arms are poliſhed, and ſo 'tis burniſhed. If you make the glaſs Concave or Convex, leſt the motion of the wheel ſhould break the Glaſs plain a piece of wood, and make it of the ſhape

               <p>I find in ſeveral writers receits for making Lakes, differing onely, either in the materials from which, or in reſpect of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> wherewith they are extracted. Some uſe <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes-berries</hi> or <hi>Grains</hi> (a ſirup whereof the <hi>Apothecaries</hi> have of a noble tincture) and they are gathered from the <hi>Ilex</hi> thence call'd <hi>Coccigera,</hi> a tree whereof you may ſee in a garden in <hi>Old-ſtreet, London,</hi> neer the <hi>Peſt-houſe,</hi> but it never bore fruit in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> another grew in his Majeſties <hi>Privy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garden</hi> at <hi>VVhite-hall,</hi> but 'twas lately cut down, by the ignorant uſurpers.

               <p>The moſt exquiſite is made by beating it with the water of the dicoction of the tree call'd <hi>Tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuatl,</hi> adding <hi>Alum,</hi> and the ſetling is form'd into <hi>Cakes.</hi>

Now all writers proceed the ſame way in diſcharging
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:53743:187"/>
the colour, precipitating ſtreyning and drying the Lake made. As to the laſt I ſhall add this, that <hi>Chalk-ſtones</hi> ſooner dry by imbibing the moiſture than Bricks do, as the conſtant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Painters in making Pastils, and of the Refiners in drying their <hi>Verditers</hi> confirmeth.

            <p>They are made of <hi>Green-glaſs</hi> well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined; till the Metall (as they call it) be well refined, they do not at all ſucceed, but crack and break, ſoon after they are drop't into the water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:53743:190"/>The beſt way of making them, is to take up ſome of the Metall out of the pot upon the end of an Iron rod, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately let it drop into cold water, and there lye till it cool.</p>
            <p>If the Metall be too hot when it drops into the water, the Glaſs drop certainly froſts and cracks all over, and falls to pieces in the water.</p>
            <p>Every one that Cracks not in the water, and lies in it, till it be quite cold, is ſure to be good.</p>
            <p>The moſt expert Workmen, know not the juſt temper of heat, that is requiſite, and therefore cannot promiſe before hand to make one that ſhall prove good, and many of them miſcarry in the making, ſometimes two or three or more for one that hits.</p>
            <p>Some of them froſt, but the body falls not into pieces; others break into pieces before the red heat be quite over, and with a ſmall noiſe; other ſoon after the red heat is over, and with a great noiſe; ſome neither break nor crack, till they ſeem to be quite cold; others keep whole whileſt they are in the water, and fly to pieces of themſelves with a ſmart noiſe as
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:53743:191"/>
ſoon as they are taken out of the water; ſome an hour after, others keep whole ſome days or weeks, and then break with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being touched.</p>
            <p>If one of them be ſnatched out of the water whilſt it is red hot, the ſmall part of the neck, and ſo much of the thred or ſtring it hangs by, as has been in the water, will upon breaking fall into ſmall parts, but not the Body, although it have as large cavities in it, as thoſe that fly in pieces.</p>
            <p>If one of them be cooled in the air, hanging at a thread, or on the ground, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes like other Glaſs, in all reſpects, as ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>When a Glaſs drop falls into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it makes a little hiſsing noiſe, the body of it continues red a pretty while, and and there proceed from it many eruptions like ſparkles, that crack, and make it leap up and move, and many bubbles do ariſe from it in the water, every where about it, till it cool: but if the water be ten or twelve Inches deep, theſe bubles diminiſh ſo in the aſcending, that they vaniſh before they attain the ſuperficies of the water; where nothing is to be obſerved, but a little thin ſteam.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:53743:191"/>The outſide of the Glaſs drop is cloſe and ſmooth like other Glaſs, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is ſpungious, and full of Cavities or Blebs.</p>
            <p>The figure of it is roundiſh at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom for the moſt part, not unlike a pear pearl, it terminates in a long neck, ſo that never any of them are ſtraight, and moſt of them are Crooked and bowed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſmall folds and wreaths from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the neck till it end in a ſmall point.</p>
            <p>Almoſt all thoſe that are made in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have a little proturberance or knob a little above the largeſt part of the body, and moſt commonly placed on the ſide towards which the neck ends, although ſometimes it be upon that ſide that lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt in the veſſel where it is made.</p>
            <p>If a Glaſs drop be let fall into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſcalding hot, it will be ſure to crack and break in the water either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the red heat be over, or ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>In Sallet Oyl they do not miſcarry ſo ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as in cold water.</p>
            <p>In oyl they produce a greater number of bubbles, and larger ones, and they
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:53743:192"/>
bubble in oyl longer than in water.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that are made in oyl have not ſo many, nor ſo large blebs in them, as thoſe made in water, and divers of them are ſmooth all over, and want thoſe little knobs that the others have.</p>
            <p>Some part of the neck of thoſe that are made in oyl, &amp; that part of the ſmall thread that is quenched in it cool'd, breaks like common Glaſs. But if the neck be broken neer the body, and the body held cloſe in ones hand, it will crack and break all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: but flies not into ſo ſmall parts, nor with ſo ſmart a force and noiſe as thoſe made in water, and the pieces will hold together till they be parted: and then there appears long ſtreaks or rays upon them, pointing towards the center or mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the body, and thwarting the little blebs or cavities of it, wherof the number is not ſo great, not the ſize ſo large as in thoſe made in water; if the Glaſs drops be dropt into vineger, they froſt and crack, ſo as they are ſure to fall to pieces before they be cold, the noiſe of falling in is more hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing than in water, but the bubbles not ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable.</p>
            <p>In milk they make no noiſe, nor any
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:53743:192"/>
bubbles that can be perceived, and never miſs to froſt and crack, and fall in pieces before they be cold.</p>
            <p>In ſpirit of wine they bubble more than in any of the other liquors, and while they remain entire, tumble too and fro, and are more agitated than in other liquors, and never fail to crack and fall in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>By that time five or ſix are dropt into the ſpirit of wine, it will be ſet on flame: but receive, no particular taſte from them.</p>
            <p>In water wherein <hi>Nitre</hi> or <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> hath been diſſolved, they ſucceed no better than in vineger.</p>
            <p>In oyl of <hi>Turpentine</hi> one of them broke, as in the ſpirit of wine, but the ſecond ſet it on fire, ſo as it could no more be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Quick-ſilver,</hi> being forced to ſink with a ſtick, it grew flat and rough on the upper ſide: but the experiment could not be perfected, becauſe it could not be kept under till it cool'd.</p>
            <p>In an experiment made in a Cylindrical Glaſs, like a beaker filled with cold water, of ſeven or eight onely one ſucceeded, the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:53743:193"/>
reſt all cracking and breaking into pieces, onely ſome of the company, who taking the Glaſs in their hand; aſſoon as the drop was let fall into it, obſerved that at the firſt falling in, and for ſome time after, whilſt the red heat laſted, red ſparks were ſhot forth from the drops into the water, and that at the inſtant of the cruption of thoſe particles, and of the bubbles which manifeſtly break out of it into the water, it not only cracks and ſometimes with conſiderable noiſe, but the body moves and leaps, as well of thoſe that remain whole in the water, as thoſe that break.</p>
            <p>A blow with a ſmall hammer, or other hard tool will not break one of the Glaſs Drops made in water, if it be touched no where but on the body.</p>
            <p>Break of the tip of it, and it will fly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately into very minute parts with a ſmart force, and noiſe, and theſe parts will eaſily crumble into a coarſe duſt.</p>
            <p>If it be broken, ſo that the ſparks of it may have liberty to fly every way, they will diſperſe themſelves in an orb, with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence like a little Granado.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="361" facs="tcp:53743:193"/>Some being rubed upon a dry tyle, fly into pieces by that time the bottom is a little flatted, others not till half be rub'd off. One being rub'd till about half was ground away, and then layed aſide, did a little while after, fly in pieces without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing touched. Another rub'd almoſt to the very neck on a ſtone with water and <hi>Emery</hi> did not fly at all.</p>
            <p>If one of them be broken in ones hand under water, it ſtrikes the hand more ſmartly, and with a more brisk noiſe than in the air: yea, though it be held near the ſuperficies, none of the ſmall parts will fly out of it, but all fall down without diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing as they do in the Air. One of them broken in Maſter <hi>Boyles</hi> Engine, when the Receiver is well Evacuated will fly in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as in the open air.</p>
            <p>Anneal one of them in the fire, and it will become like ordinary Glaſs, onely the ſpring of it is ſo weakned, that it will not bend ſo much without breaking, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>A Glaſs drop being faſtned into a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all but a part of the neck, and then the tip of it broken off, it made a pretty ſmart noiſe, but not ſo great as thoſe uſe to do
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:53743:194"/>
that are broken in the hand, and though it clearly appears to be all ſhiver'd within, and the colours turned grayiſh, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide remained ſmooth, though cracked, and being taken in pieces, the parts of it riſe in flakes, ſome Conical in ſhape, and ſo crack all over, that it eaſily crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to duſt.</p>
            <p>One faſtned in a ball of cement ſome half an Inch in thickneſs, upon the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the tip of it, it broke the ball in pieces like a Granado.</p>
            <p>Two or three of them ſent to a <hi>Lapida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to peirce them thorow, as they do Pearls, no ſooner had the tool entred into them, but they flew in pieces as they uſe to do when the tip of them is broken off.</p>

               <hi>Ponte</hi> is the Iron to ſtick the Glaſs at the bottom for the more convenient faſhioning the neck of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pontee ſtake</hi> is the Iron whereon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitors place the Irons from the Maſters when they have knock't off the bhoken pieces of Glaſs.</p>
